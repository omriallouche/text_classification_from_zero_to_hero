According to the NY Times, the 4 islands ""belong[] to the United Arab
Emirates."" 


Why is it, then, that when the British, Iranians and UAE refer to
Occupied Territory, they mean territory in dispute in Israel but not
in their own affairs?

That's why the Zionists decided that Zion must be Gentile-rein.
What?!  They didn't?!  You mean to tell me that the early Zionists
actually granted CITIZENSHIP in the Jewish state to Christian and
Muslim people, too?  

It seems, Elias, that your ""first point to note"" is wrong, so the rest
of your posting isn't worth much, either.

So was it on CNN or not?

Yes, like the 700 or more Palestinians brutally murdered by their brothers.

called Love? It used to play some role in people's considerations
for getting married. Of course I know some people who married

child for 18,000$? The power of AA is limited. Your proposal is
indeed unconventional.

As I remember, someone did ask if UV had a speach code. But, really,
there is no need for this brief survey course.

That was uncalled for. I'm sure Andi Beyer or whatever his name is
