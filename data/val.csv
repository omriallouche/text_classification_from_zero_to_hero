First, a longer game in no way suggests ""more baseball to watch,"" unless
you include watching the grass grow as baseball.  The lengthier games
are so because of batters stepping out of the box, pitchers taking
longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers
and pitching coaches.

And while it's true that the gaps between plays can be interesting, this
is only true when they don't become extra-long.  Quickly-pitched games
can grab and hold your attention much better.

I applauded the Sabres for making the deal to get Fuhr, specifically because I
thought it would help them win at least one playoff series.  However, I don't
think the Leafs can be faulted either...there is nothing to say that Felix
won't be winning playoff series by himself in years to come.  

Anyway, does anybody else find it ironic that Fuhr is up against Moog? (or at
least he was until a guy named Alex showed up....:-) )

Never mind the fact that these people were denied the right to a fair trial.

Check your facts before bashing Islam again. While there may be Muslim

""basic"" to Islam is implicating the entire Muslim world, based on a selective  
sampling of a few people, and it flies in the face of what Islam teaches.

	Chris Valentine
