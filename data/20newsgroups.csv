As far as I know, Toronto, Pittsburgh, and New York (NL) change their
uniforms every year.  Every other year (e.g., New York), it will say Mets
in cursive, New York in cursive, or New York in all caps.  Minor changes,
but they do change them often.  Last year, I think they had New York in all
caps.  Did Toronto have Blue Jays or Toronto last year?  What about
Pittsburgh?

Once he called it a strike the call could not be changed.

There is a great book out called ""They Also Served"" which is about the 
ballplayers during WWII.  There is some info on Berg in there.  It also has 
info on Pete Gray (one armed outfielder) and other players of the era.  Because
of the draft many players during the war were those who were exempt from the

First, a longer game in no way suggests ""more baseball to watch,"" unless
you include watching the grass grow as baseball.  The lengthier games
are so because of batters stepping out of the box, pitchers taking
longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers
and pitching coaches.

And while it's true that the gaps between plays can be interesting, this
is only true when they don't become extra-long.  Quickly-pitched games
can grab and hold your attention much better.

golf game with it!)",0,rec.sport.baseball,"first , a longer game in no way suggests ""more baseball to watch ,"" unless you include watching the grass grow as baseball . the lengthier games are so because of batters stepping out of the box , pitchers taking longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers and pitching coaches . and while it's true that the gaps between plays can be interesting , this is only true when they don't become extra-long . quickly-pitched games can grab and hold your attention much better . bring back the two-hour baseball game!

Well, I don't want shorter games *per se*, but I would like for them to stop

When a guy comes to the plate, he should be up there to hit, not show off

I wondered the same thing.  When he first mentioned it, I thought he was
just making a mistake but then he said it over and over.  And then in the
examples from other years, he gave stats for players from both leagues even
when only one league expanded.

So (since stats *NEVER* lie :-) ), I guess there is an effect on both leagues
because the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making 
every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up
players that, normally, they would not have had there not been expansion.",0,rec.sport.baseball,"i wondered the same thing . when he first mentioned it , i thought he was just making a mistake but then he said it over and over . and then in the examples from other years , he gave stats for players from both leagues even when only one league expanded . so (since stats *never* lie :-) ) , i guess there is an effect on both leagues because the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up players that , normally , they would not have had there not been expansion .",560

(1)   Batting Williams ahead of Bonds will create a Left(Clark),

      to change pitchers.

      so much with breaking balls.  Opposing pitchers don't want to
      walk Williams to get to Bonds.

I'm not sure I understand this question. When the IF rule is invoked,
the batter is automatically out. This relieves the runners from being
forced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught. Other
than that, isn't it just the same as any situation in which a runner on
a base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball? That is,
if the ball is caught he can tag up and run (or decide to stay), and
if the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time.

If I remember correctly (Which is always in doubt), Horner's signing

he could have gone back to Arizona St. for one more year if he hadn't

it lead to a week-long walkout.  Methinks Horner had no work ethic
before he was drafted, and minor league play wouldn't have helped.

keep him there for a while, until he started falling on his wrists.

Methinks you recall wrong. Mitchell hit close to .300 in Atlanta and 
continued to walk alot after his promotion. He was then (I think) left
off the playoff roster, and started the next year in the minors where
even the Braves will tell you he underperformed because he was so mad
at going back down. 

he struggled last year, no doubt, but even the Braves blamed part of it
on the demotion. I'd much rather have Mitchell than say Mark Whiten on

Interesting article, Craig.  It's amazing how hard it is to get baseball
teams to understand how to properly market their teams and treat their
customers.  No other business could ever get away with the 19th century 
attitudes that most current owners display in running their clubs.  I guess the
owners look at baseball's high growth rate and ask why it's necessary
to bring 20th century business practices into the game, but they don't
realize how much more growth the game is capable of and how much they
pay in terms of long-term popularity by not doing better by the game

I happen to be a big fan of Jayson Stark.  He is a baseball writer for the 
Philadelphia Inquirer.  Every tuesday he writes a ""Week in Review"" column.  
He writes about unusual situations that occured during the week.  Unusual
stats.  He has a section called ""Kinerisms of the Week"" which are stupid
lines by Mets brodcaster Ralph Kiner.  Every year he has the LGTGAH contest.
That stands for ""Last guy to get a hit.""  He also writes for Baseball 
America.  That column is sort of a highlights of ""Week in Review.""  If you 
can, check his column out sometime.  He might make you laugh.

Educate yourself before you rip on this years manager of the year.
Lankford injured himself in a previous game and Torre was resting
him.

As far as the Whitten/Gilkey controversy.  Whitten adds some more

Gilkey will find himself in the starting lineup soon enough.

not the Cubs.  I root for the Cubs, because I feel sorry for them, but

Right.  So who cares which PLAYER gets credited, as long as the TEAM

doesn't score them all himself, who cares?

Player B: grounder to short; reaches on the force at 2nd.
Player C: Double, B to 3rd.
Player D: Sac fly.

B gets a run, D gets an RBI.  Are you *sure* they helped the team
more than A and C?  Think hard, now.

Potvin did not have his best evening.  Nobody that I saw thought that the

Lloyd Pettit.


Yes, it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the NHL for $50M; but
at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much 
less than that. He felt that no one would pay $50M for an expansion team, and
that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that. But
the market fooled him, and 5 teams have been created for $50M apiece in the
last three years, and even the existing teams can't be moved for less than 
$50M and I doubt that he could get one for that little.

What?! White, yes. Well off, definitely not. Hockey season ticket owners have
the lowest average income of any of the four major North American sports.

And think of where the majority of hockey players come from. From a farm out
in Boondock, Saskatchewan or Weedville, Alberta.

I think the biggest barrier to hockey in the inner city is... no ICE to play on.

I believe that Phil Esposito was the first to wear #77 when he played
with the Rangers in the '70s.  This was the season that they put the
Rangers crest and ""modern-style"" numbers on the jerseys instead of the
""NEW YORK"" or ""RANGERS"" block letters and two-colour numbers.  He took #77
because the Rangers already had a #7.

(Hockey Night in Canada made a big thing out of it, saying it was the
biggest uniform style change in a long time.  This was before Pittsburgh
and Vancouver changed their colours.)

ESPN has been trying various things to get away from the
follow-the-puck concept of televising hockey games.  One of the main
problems with hockey is that it is very difficult to show everything
that is going on -- more happens away from the puck than in any other
sport except maybe football and they can do iso's on football players
to be shown between plays.

Question:
If a team uses 40 players in a season do you merely divide the total +/-
by 40?  If so, a player who plays in only 1 game is considered equally
valuable as a player who plays in all of them.


Since the standard deviation for each team is different, I am unsure how 
""transferable"" between teams that these stats are.  Shouldn't the average
standard deviation in the league be used?

I applauded the Sabres for making the deal to get Fuhr, specifically because I
thought it would help them win at least one playoff series.  However, I don't
think the Leafs can be faulted either...there is nothing to say that Felix
won't be winning playoff series by himself in years to come.

With a split contract, SCA could have at least gotten at leftovers

 Well, I'm a Wings fan and I think the FIRST thing that you should do is to
get the opponent's line combinations correct before you try to match up anyone

powerplay.  These three players usually play on three different lines.
Which would mean that Toronto's checking line would have to pull a triple
shift.

Why?  I note that the available psych info says that feelings of
security INCREASE.  The victimization stats say that that increase
is rational.


Yes, they are, but how?


Nope - that doesn't happen.  Instead the switch (among those who
change behaviors) to property crimes.  That's an improvement even if
the economic take is unchanged.  Sure - not everyone switches, but
they were killing before.

Consider this: The BDs had more than one lamp; The tanks made more than
one hole in the building. Did anyone else notice on the video that it
appeared that wherever there was smoke coming out of the building, there
was a tank nearby?

The fact that it appears that fires started in several places does not
rule out anything.

Also, where are these several witnesses? The way I heard it (from the FBI
spokesman on CNN) the ""witnesses"" were all people driving the tanks.

With one exception, that's a pretty good description of many of the

between an M-16 and an AR-15.  Heck - they even know that ""it looks

No, we argue that it was not entirely unreasonable for a woodstove to be

Obviously you missed my earlier posting about the physica of woodstoves.
In brief, you can't turn your woodstove on and off like your gas range.
It stays on all the time.  It even stays ""on"" for over 24 hours AFTER you
shut it off (which is why most working woodstoves aren't ever ""shut off""

1. There is a similar idea here in ex-USSR about how many militioners it needs
   to place a new electric lamp. The answer is nine: one stays on a table and
   holds the lamp, four hold the table and turn it and yet four run around the
   table in opposite direction not to make the first feel bad (when being
   turned). Pitily, it lacks this kind of dark humour as Nick's msg does.

If the Israelis are stupid enough to ""allow"" a second ""Palestinian""

wish - and the Israelis would get what's coming to them.

However, if the ""Palestinians"" were to somehow demonstrate that

Jerusalem as a part of their state - and you would be disappointed.

	One of these days you'll learn that the way to stop Israel
from fighting back is to stop attacking.  If there were no attacks in
the security zone for a year because the Lebanese army could maintain
the peace, then Lebanon would be in much better shape.

	Tell me something, though.  Why do Syrian troops not get
attacked?  Aren't they occupying Lebanon?

	Israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave on two
conditions.  One is a demonstration that the Lebanese army can keep
the peace.  The second is that the Syrians pull out as well.

     Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman told journalists Turkey was
     closing its air space to all flights to and from Armenia and would
     prevent humanitarian aid from reaching the republic overland across
     Turkish territory.

  
   Historically even the most uncivilized of peoples have exhibited 
   signs of compassion by allowing humanitarian aid to reach civilian
   populations. Even the Nazis did this much.

   themselves 'hypocrites' should they choose to continue their
   condemnation of the Serbians.

Actually, this is incorrect.  French resistance may have played some
part in hindering the German war effort, however the crucial role was
supplied on D-Day.


Interesting statement.  Especially when you consider that Lebanon
had claimed to have made progress in the peace talks, as well as
Israel.  Of course, one of the prime obstacles to Israel's complete
withdrawal is the lack of governmental control that can be applied
to the area as well as the large presence of Syrian forces which
have not been asked to withdraw as well.

Maybe, some student of history may put this in perspective.

",3,talk.politics.mideast,"my reference is a 4 page essay in our local star tribute newspaper putting the whole conflict in perspective . i will readily admit that i am no authority in this area; however , other posteers asserted that *some* muslims did join hands with croats and nazis in persecuting serbs . in any case , past actions do not in any way validate or legitimize what is happending there now . i sincerely do apologize to the extent the author of the essay was wrong in making the assertion he made . maybe , some student of history may put this in perspective . satya prabhakar",566

The wars of 1948, 1956, 1967, 1978 were definitely started by the Arabs.
The war in 1982 was instigated by the Arabs who continually murdered
Israeli children with their rocket attacks.  Israel was only trying to
stop this.  
Last what the heck are you talking about with ""1968 (Karama)""?  There was 
no war in 1968!

You're just beginning to scratch the surface.  Do you know how much
military equipment costs?  When was the last time you tried to buy a
mil-spec hammer, coffee-pot or toilet seat?  

Paying Israel to do the dirty work on it's own without putting
American soldiers's lives on the line is much, much, much cheaper than
Uncle Sam's arrangements with much of the rest of the world.

# Well said Mr. Beyer :)

He-he. The great humanist speaks. One has to read Mr. Salah's posters,
in which he decribes Jews as ""sons of pigs and monkeys"", keeps
promising the ""final battle"" between Muslims and Jews (in which the
stons and the trees will ""cry for the Muslims to come and kill the
Jews hiding behind them""), makes jokes about Jews dying from heart
attacks etc, to realize his objective stance on the matters involved.",3,talk.politics.mideast,"# well said mr . beyer :) he-he . the great humanist speaks . one has to read mr . salah's posters , in which he decribes jews as ""sons of pigs and monkeys"" , keeps promising the ""final battle"" between muslims and jews (in which the stons and the trees will ""cry for the muslims to come and kill the jews hiding behind them"") , makes jokes about jews dying from heart attacks etc , to realize his objective stance on the matters involved .",439
