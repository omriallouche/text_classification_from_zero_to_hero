There is a great book out called ""They Also Served"" which is about the 
ballplayers during WWII.  There is some info on Berg in there.  It also has 
info on Pete Gray (one armed outfielder) and other players of the era.  Because
of the draft many players during the war were those who were exempt from the
draft for medical reasons.  There are some very interesting stories in the
book. It is very well written and I would suggest reading it to anyone with an 
interest in baseball.

If I remember correctly (Which is always in doubt), Horner's signing

he could have gone back to Arizona St. for one more year if he hadn't

it lead to a week-long walkout.  Methinks Horner had no work ethic
before he was drafted, and minor league play wouldn't have helped.

keep him there for a while, until he started falling on his wrists.

 Well, I'm a Wings fan and I think the FIRST thing that you should do is to
get the opponent's line combinations correct before you try to match up anyone
with them.  There is no Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert line, except for maybe on a
powerplay.  These three players usually play on three different lines.
Which would mean that Toronto's checking line would have to pull a triple
shift.
The Wings' lines usually look like this:

It would seem to me that the act of possessing a machine gun is no less
""criminal"", by definition, than the act of possessing a television set. I also would seem
to me that it would be better to pass laws that say, that if I harm
or kill someone with the machine gun or the television set that there 
would be specific penalties for doing such.

Why is it, then, that when the British, Iranians and UAE refer to
Occupied Territory, they mean territory in dispute in Israel but not
in their own affairs?

I couldn't agree more.  Canada has an anti-hate law which exists to punish
those who wilfully spread false propaganda (lies) for the purpose of 
putting down another group.  This is actually the law that David Irving
will hopefully be found guilty under due to his denial of the Holocaust.
It's too bad that this useless ""Centre for Policy Research"" isn't in Canada.
It'd set a nice precedent to how the law applies in Cyberspace.

Mentioning that Turkic people are wide-spread means desiring a Turkish empire?
Is that the logical thing to conclude from a statement like that? 
To me it just says that Turkey may have economical benefits from that
if she can be competitive enough. No more than that. But of course
you have the freedom of extrapolating as you wish from any statement.

The Hamas terrorists were given the opportunity to appeal.  They've
chosen not to, obviously because they get better propaganda mileage
out of refusing.

Israel also agreed that they could return immediately, provided they
agreed to stop killing Jews.  Their refusal speaks for itself.

Right now, I'm just going to address this point.
When the Jewish National Fund bought most of its land,
It didn't buy it from the Palestinians themselves, because,
for the most part, they were tenant farmers (fallahin),
living on land owned by wealthy Arabs in Syria and Lebanon.
The JNF offered a premium deal, so the owners took advantage of
it.   It's called commerce.  The owners, however, made no 
provisions for those who had worked for them, basically shafting 
them by selling the land right out from under them.
They are to blame, not the Jews.
