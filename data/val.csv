There are various contradictory views on the origin of the Armenians.
The name is to be found in the Darian inscriptions in the form 'Armina'
or 'Aramaniya' is to be found in the inscription on the Bistun monument.
The following references to the Armenians are to be found in the Bistun
cuneiform inscription of Dara Vishdasb (510 B.C.).


 6. On reaching Arminam 'Armeniya'.

 7. To the country town of Zozo, to Armaniya 'Armeniya'.

According to Karakashian:

As for 'Armenia', the equivalent of the 'Armin' or 'Arminik' of the Persians,
this is more recent than the word 'Ararat', and is to be found used in
the Dara inscriptions for 'Haiastan'.  

Saint Martin:

The name 'Armenie' has been given since very early times by almost all
the various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the Armenians
as 'Haiastan'. It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs
as Ermeniyye.
 
Others believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as 'Harminap'
which was later modified by the Persians to 'Arminia'. 'Ar' refers to a
place, as in Ararat, Archish, Aruyr, Archar, Arshav, Arazen and Aror, 
while 'men' is used to refer to spirit, thought or human being, and 
therefore 'Armen' would appear to signify 'the people of that place'.

G. Alishan believes that 'according to our national vocabulary ""Haik""
is the diminutive form of ""Hai"", and that ""Hai"" is the name of our
nation. Our nation is in no way connected with the word ""Armen"" that
foreigners apply to our people.'

It would thus appear that 'Armenia' is a place-name, that 'Armen' is 
the name of the people who lived there, and that these are in no way
connected with the word 'Hai'.

Haik and Haiastan:

Armenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom
the Armenian people took the name 'Hai'. But the mere resemblance
between the words 'Haik' and 'Hai' constitutes no real proof, and,
in any case, no such theory appears before the time of Moses of
Khoren.

Haiasa:

The following studies show quite clearly that 'Hai' and 'Haiasa' were
no more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the 
region known as Armenia.

Professor Hachadurian: 'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite
inscriptions for Upper Armenia.'

Yensen, in his 'Hittites and Armenians' tries to prove that 'Hai' is
identical with the Hittite 'Hatio', in other words that 'Hai' is a
Hittite word. Research, however, has proved this erroneous, and shown
that 'Hai' was derived from 'Hatio'.

Mortman's attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with 
no success. As for Greek, there is no point in even mentioning it.

The resemblance between the words 'Haiasa' and 'Haiastan' is so obvious
that we may well accept 'Haiasa' as the oldest form of 'Haiastan'.

Let us now cast a brief glance on how the words 'Hai', 'Haikazan' and
'Haiastan' entered our older works.

According to Karakashian: 

'The word ""Haik"" is never to be found employed with reference to a
leader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren, nor is it
ever found employed in the forms ""Haika"" or ""Haykazn"".

Agahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (he
improved and developed Haiastan, etc.). If the word had referred
to a nation and had been derived from ""Hai"" or ""Haik"" they could 
also have used the words ""Haikak"" and ""Haykazn"" in a number of
places.'

According to Professor Sayce, who deciphered a number of Hittite 
inscriptions:

'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality
or species. The words ""Haddanas"", ""Haddina"" were used by the 
Assyrians to refer to the Hittites. With the transformation of the
""d"" between the two ""a"" letters to ""y"" ""Hadinasdani"" was in this
way transformed to ""Haiastan""'.

Professor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view, but regards
the significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms 'Hai'
and 'Haistan' as quite unsatisfactory. He finds, however, that a 
solution to this problem is brought nearer by the name 'Haiasa' 
which is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C. onwards.
Forrer takes 'Haiasa' as referring to Upper Armenia. In that case
it seems likely that 'Haiasa' was actually a part of Armenia. The
suffix -dan is of Anatolian origin. The real root is 'Hayasa', which
refers to the country of the 'Hayasas'.

E. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological 
and Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people.

The Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows: Almost
all of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic, very dark,
above average height, an Aissores Asian group with close ties
with certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples.

According to J. Deniker:

From the philological point of view, the Armenian and Kurds may be
regarded as belonging to the Iranian group...The Armenians are 
descended from various elements and from a very mixed race. Their
average height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region.
They are almost always short-headed, with skull measurements of 
85-87. As a race they belong to the Indo-Afghan-Assyrian-Turkic
family.

Professor Rene Vernont writes as follows:

The Armenians are a mixture of Semites, Turk, Kurds and Mongols,
but some of them display Armenian features, e.g., height a little
above average, fair complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, very often
a hooked nose and a rather wide mouth. 

Investigations carried out by N. Kossovitch on the links between
Armenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristics
led him to the conclusion that the Armenians did not form a 
distinct race.

Well, when you say, without Morris, you have to mention an assumed
replacement.  If the alternative to Morris was letting Cito Gaston
soft-toss the ball underhand to the opposition every 5 days, then
of course the Blue Jays wouldn't have won without Morris.  If the
alternative was replacement level, then I think it would've been very
close, and yes, Morris might've made the difference.  If the alternative
was Frank Viola, the Blue Jays probably would have won more easily with
Viola.


Yes.  You can make the argument that the his presence prevented 
the team from collapsing in August.


Those innings were probably helpful.


Well, I think is complete bs.  What happened most of the time is that
Morris fell behind, and the team came back and rescued him.  Mostly,
this is because he's a lousy 1st inning pitcher, and much better
the rest of the way.  That the team can climb out of 4-0, 5-0 holes
consistently and win them 6-5 is not to Morris' credit; it's to the
team's credit.

Furthermore, while Morris did exceed the W-L percentage that would
be projected from his runs allowed and run support, he hasn't done
this in previous years.  In fact, his W-L record in 1991 is a lot
worse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed.
Do you think he just came up with this ability in 1992.

Look at the 2 postseason games he pitched decently in.  Typical
Morris games.  Morris gets behind; team rescues him.  He's not
responsible for that rescue.  And in both those games, the team
just didn't rescue him enough.  Jack Morris pitched as well as he did
during much of the season in those 2 games; the offense just didn't
earn him a victory.

Gant shouldn't have ignored Hirschbeck.  Not returning made the strike

Gant tossed altogether.  But if Hirschbeck had let Gant step out, the

1528,"The Colorado Daily recently reprinted the Wall Street Journal's article
on Paxton Quigley, including the nefarious little paragraph the Journal
tacked onto the end.  After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G.
type folks, I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph,
and surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it.  The text follows.
The Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student
(I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess...

(The title was the only thing they changed/added)

""Gun Stats""

The Daily recently reprinted an article from the
Wall Street Journal, primarily concerned with Paxton
Quigley, author of ""Armed and Female.""  The article,
in turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally
reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The
article states, ""A study... found that a gun in the home
was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,
spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder.""  This
is an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev-
eral reasons, outlined below:

The study gives the impression that, if you own a 
gun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to 
defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned
against you.  The study, however, fails to take into
account cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun 
to thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe-
trator.

The study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather
than 'friend'.  This would include the friendly neigh-
borhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every
month, the second your grandmother cashes her social
security check.  Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a
friend.

The NEJM study is based on the immediate dis-
position of cases and fails to take into account cases
originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be
self-defense.  Especially considering the small sample 
size (396), taking these events into account has a sub-
stantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted.

Criminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif-
erent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be 
used, successfully, by a private citizen against an 
aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per-
sons defending themselves from aggression by using a 
gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by
some other means, or who offer no resistance at all.
Statistics available from the FBI and other agencies 
also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be
used by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat
than to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times
more likely to be used to defend against a criminal
threat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times
more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be
used to commit suicide.

It is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can 
be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One has
to consider carefully what questions were asked by
those gathering the data before one can draw an accu-
rate conclusion from them.

3075,"#21	PETER AHOLA		Season: 2nd
Acquired:	'92-93, trade with Pittsburgh for future considerations
Grade:		I (B)

It is way too early to tell about Ahola, who was acquired probably because the
Penguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft.  Ahola had
only played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose
Mercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he
has played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been
spectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points);
it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn
out to be ... Peter Ahola.

#24	DOUG WILSON		Season: 16th
Acquired:	'91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and
		2nd round pick in '92 entry draft
Grade:		I (B)

I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high
expectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out.
Nevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and
playmaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which,
unfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to
catch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for
2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be
Wilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.

#29	DEAN KOLSTAD		Season:	2nd
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		I (C-/D+)

It's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of
games (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's
quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games,
he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of
the first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with
the Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward
with his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in
his level of performance to have any chance of making the team.

#38	PAT MACLEOD		Season: 2nd
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		I (?)

MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my
memory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to
use him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that
he wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with
Kansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,
a ""rehab assignment"" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.
Since he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but
he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive
skills.

#41	TOM PEDERSON		Season: 1st
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		I (B+)

Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated
by injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours
truly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in
43 games.  However, his size (5' 9"", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after
he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,
on both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.
But to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance
on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.

#45	CLAUDIO SCREMIN		Season: 1st
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		I (D+/D)

He played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly
umimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a
small sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is
quickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or
defense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that
will go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he
was once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.",1,rec.sport.hockey,"#21 peter ahola season: 2nd acquired: '92-93 , trade with pittsburgh for future considerations grade: i (b) it is way too early to tell about ahola , who was acquired probably because the penguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft . ahola had only played 50 games this season (i think it's actually less; the san jose mercury news may be in err here) , 20 of them with the sharks . in the games he has played , he appeared quite solid defensively , although he hasn't been spectacular , and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points); it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn out to be . . . peter ahola . #24 doug wilson season: 16th acquired: '91-92 , trade with chicago for rw kerry toporowski and 2nd round pick in '92 entry draft grade: i (b) i have often been accused of overly down on wilson; i may have had too high expectations for him , but his legs , knees , et al . , are giving out . nevertheless , when he was playing , he exhibited a strong shooting and playmaking abilities , even if he has lost a step on defense , which , unfortunately , he demonstrated this year as well , as at times he was slow to catch the opponent forwards , and his offensive output was only good enough for 2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games) . but next year , which may be wilson's last , if he can stay healthy , he can still be a contributor . #29 dean kolstad season: 2nd acquired: '91-92 , from minnesota in dispersal draft grade: i (c-/d+) it's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge kolstad on just a handful of games (forgetting exact number , but no more than 15) , but at age 25 he's quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the nhl . in those games , he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of the first game he played , he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with the sharks , and was even less impressive defensively , as he appeared awkward with his movement and was prone to giveaways . he needs to make a leap in his level of performance to have any chance of making the team . #38 pat macleod season: 2nd acquired: '91-92 , from minnesota in dispersal draft grade: i ( ?) macleod was on the roster a lot longer than kolstad , but it appears to my memory that he played less than kolstad , because the sharks were reluctant to use him , but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors , figuring that he wouldn't clear waivers; in fact , he has played the past 4-5 weeks with kansas city , but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment , a ""rehab assignment"" that will include him playing in the turner cup playoffs . since he has played so little , i can't even give a tentative grade on him , but he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive skills . #41 tom pederson season: 1st acquired: '91-92 , from minnesota in dispersal draft grade: i (b+) called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated by injuries , pederson impressed many sharks fan here on net , including yours truly . he demonstrated very good offensive skills , scoring 20 points in 43 games . however , his size (5' 9"" , 165 lbs .) is of concern , and soon after he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically , on both sides of the ice , although he had appeared fearless in his approach . but to be successful , he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league . #45 claudio scremin season: 1st acquired: '91-92 , from minnesota in dispersal draft grade: i (d+/d) he played all of ~5 games in the league this year , but was thoroughly umimpressive , just as he was at the end of last season; again , it may be a small sample , but just as in the case of kolstad , scremin , at age 25 , is quickly running out of time . he was not a contributor on either offense or defense in the games he played with the sharks . the only notable thing that will go down in scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he was once traded for now capitals goaltender don beaupre .",4170

Ten questions to Israelis
-------------------------

I would be thankful if any of you who live in Israel could help to
provide
 accurate answers to the following specific questions. These are
indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by
people around me.

1.      Is it true that the Israeli authorities don't recognize
Israeli nationality ? And that ID cards, which Israeli citizens
must carry at all times, identify people as Jews or Arabs, not as
Israelis ?

2.      Is it true that the State of Israel has no fixed borders
and that Israeli governments from 1948 until today have refused to
state where the ultimate borders of the State of Israel should be
?

3.      Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons ? If so,
could you provide any evidence ?

4.      Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of
individuals which were tried in secret and for which their
identities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are
state secrets ?

5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the occupied
territories are subject to different laws than non-Jews?

6.      Is it true that Jews who left Palestine in the war 1947/48
to avoid the war were automatically allowed to return, while their
Christian neighbors who did the same were not allowed to return ?

7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed
an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948, as is done today in
Bosnia-Herzegovina ?

8.      Is it true that Israeli Arab citizens are not admitted as
members in kibbutzim?

9.      Is it true that Israeli law attempts to discourage
marriages between Jews and non-Jews ?

10.     Is it true that Hotel Hilton in Tel Aviv is built on the
site of a muslim cemetery ?

Right.  Most definitely.


This may be the root of the confusion...

Please consider the following hypothetical with an open mind.  Note
that I am *not* (yet) saying that it has anything to do with the
question at hand.

Suppose we have a simplified Lotto game.  You pick a number from 1-10
and win if that number is drawn.  Suppose we have a large population
of people who play this game every week.

In the first year of the game, approximately 1/4 of the population
will win 7 or more times.

In the second year of the game, 1/4 of those 7-time winners will again
be 7-time winners.

In the third year of the game, 1/4 of those who won 7 or more times in
each of the first two years will win 7 again.

Suppose I started with 1024 people in my population.  After three
years, I have 32 people who have consistently, in each of the last
three years, won 140% or more the number of times expected.

Do we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game?
No.  Because we know there is no skill involved.  Nothing about these
""consistent winners"" can influence their chances of winning.  But
suppose we *don't* know whether or not there is a chance that skill
might be involved.  Perhaps some of the people in our population are
psychic, or something.  How would we test this hypothesis?

We can look for correlations in the population.  Now most of the
population will show zero correlation.  But our psychics should show a
high positive correlation (even if they aren't very good psychics,
they should still manage to win 7 or more times most years).  Net
result?  A small positive correlation over the entire population.


Well, zero correlation is zero correlation.  You mention that Sabo has
hit poorly in the clutch over the last 3(?) years.  But if we look at
the past, we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse
as they are to remain consistent.  The length of the streak doesn't
seem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be
clutch or choke the next year.  Is there any reason to expect *this*
streak to be different from past streaks?

Now if it were true that ""75% of all three-year streaks remained true
to form"", then we might have something useful.  But then we wouldn't
have zero correlation.  Instead we have ""50% of all three-year streaks
remain true to form, and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse"".  You
look at those numbers and say ""three year choke streak implies more
likely to choke this year"".  But it would be equally valid to look at
those numbers and say ""three year choke streak implies more likely to
be clutch this year"", since the probabilities are split 50-50 each
way.


Then we would have something useful.  And we would also have a
positive correlation.  But for every individual that exhibits such a
pattern and holds true, there is another who exhibits such a pattern
and then reverses.",0,rec.sport.baseball,"right . most definitely . this may be the root of the confusion . . . please consider the following hypothetical with an open mind . note that i am *not* (yet) saying that it has anything to do with the question at hand . suppose we have a simplified lotto game . you pick a number from 1-10 and win if that number is drawn . suppose we have a large population of people who play this game every week . in the first year of the game , approximately 1/4 of the population will win 7 or more times . in the second year of the game , 1/4 of those 7-time winners will again be 7-time winners . in the third year of the game , 1/4 of those who won 7 or more times in each of the first two years will win 7 again . suppose i started with 1024 people in my population . after three years , i have 32 people who have consistently , in each of the last three years , won 140% or more the number of times expected . do we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game ? no . because we know there is no skill involved . nothing about these ""consistent winners"" can influence their chances of winning . but suppose we *don't* know whether or not there is a chance that skill might be involved . perhaps some of the people in our population are psychic , or something . how would we test this hypothesis ? we can look for correlations in the population . now most of the population will show zero correlation . but our psychics should show a high positive correlation (even if they aren't very good psychics , they should still manage to win 7 or more times most years) . net result ? a small positive correlation over the entire population . well , zero correlation is zero correlation . you mention that sabo has hit poorly in the clutch over the last 3( ?) years . but if we look at the past , we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse as they are to remain consistent . the length of the streak doesn't seem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be clutch or choke the next year . is there any reason to expect *this* streak to be different from past streaks ? now if it were true that ""75% of all three-year streaks remained true to form"" , then we might have something useful . but then we wouldn't have zero correlation . instead we have ""50% of all three-year streaks remain true to form , and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse"" . you look at those numbers and say ""three year choke streak implies more likely to choke this year"" . but it would be equally valid to look at those numbers and say ""three year choke streak implies more likely to be clutch this year"" , since the probabilities are split 50-50 each way . then we would have something useful . and we would also have a positive correlation . but for every individual that exhibits such a pattern and holds true , there is another who exhibits such a pattern and then reverses .",2893

Hey American Hockey fans,

As a hockey fan I can sympathize with thefrustration that you feel.  The
problem is that other Americans don't give a shit about hockey.  They view
it as a bunch of Canadians with bad accents and missing teeth beating the
shit out of each other on a patch of ice when it is too warm now in
two-thirds of the US to see the stuff naturally.  On the other hand
BASEBALL is the *gasp**swoon**sigh* ""NATIONAL PASTTIME"".  BASEBALL is so
romanticized in the US that you are supposed to forget that other sport
exist after April 1 and before November 1.  I feel that since ESPN shows 5+
BASEBALL games a week they should be able to show an OT hockey game instead
of the opening innings of a BASEBALL game.  Hell, the game is going to last
2hrs 45mins, so what if you miss the first 1 1/2 hrs?  And I am an Indians
fan!  Show the end of what you started, then switch!  But then, I'm a

    Your comparison with the Warsaw Ghetto uprising is insulting,
    and racist beyond belief.  The attempts to quiet any violence
    in the Gaza Strip are just that.  The efforts to quell murder
    and mayhem in the Gaza strip were the resluts of violence and
    came AFTER the violence.  It was not an arbitrary racial move
    like the nazi treatment of Jews.  Jews had NOT committed acts
    of violence and murder as have the residents of Gaza.  I find 
    your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than
    anti-Israel bigotry.



    It is NOT punishment, but protection from repeated attacks by
    residents of Gaza.  You self-servingly omit any references to
    WHY Israel has had to take action.  Apparaently the deaths of
    innocent Israeli civilians do not enter into your equation, a
    racist ommission on your part.



    The right of Israel to protect its citizens from murderers is
    also recognized by international law.  Israeli civilians have
    been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis.  If this wave
    of murder does not matter to you, then your posturing for the
    basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing
    but an anti-Israel charade.



    Do you know of residents of Gaza who have applied for Israeli
    citizenship and were denied?  I have heard of no such denials
    taking place.  Can you document this, or is this more of your
    stupid and innacurate propaganda?  The truth is that if Gazan
    residents applied for citizenship, HAMAS would murder them as
    collaborators.

    How dare you use such a disgusting phrase.  How very easy you
    attack a people, when you omit facts which fly in the face of
    your pure racism.  Perhaps you are judging a people to be the
    racists that you are.  Do you believe that all Jews must have   
    the same bigoted makeup as you?  
    
    Here's another little fly in your ointment, about the 'master 
    race,' for you to avoid...

    Two months ago a plane with 86 Bosnian Muslims left Bosnia to
    seek asylum in the middle east.  Four Arab nations refused to
    grant them asylum.  Then when Israli Arabs agreed to take the
    responsibility for them, they were allowed into Israel.  Yes,
    Israel.  But when the plane landed, the Israeli Arabs who had
    previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved
    with the rescue project, because they felt that it would make
    Israel look good.  It was more important to avoid any good PR
    for Israel than to take care of fellow Muslims.  Israel moved
    them to a kibbutz, where they are safe and secure.  The truth
    is that time after time the Islamic world has turned its back
    on Muslims in need more than Israel has.  Even in the case of
    the 400 deportees, Lebanon was willing to let their so-called
    Arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary
    in Lebanon.  

    Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other
    Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel.  Hundreds of
    thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait, just
    because they were Palestinian.  The truth is that your phoney
    concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an
    excuse to attack Israel.  You are part of the ignorant effort
    to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to
    attacking Israel.  But the truth is there are greater reasons
    than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians.  To disregard
    Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oil-rich 
    nations who do nothing for these people, is to use the plight 
    of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews, or
    your hatred of Israel.  Anti-semitism and anti-Zionism is NOT
    the same as pro-Palestinian and anyone who insists that it is
    the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare.



    Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your
    racism cannot be disguised.  Jews had never declared war on a
    Polish people.  Jews had never attacked Poles with knives, or
    had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks.  To take
    something like the Warsaw Ghetto(the creation of which you do
    not even bother to discuss!)and the uprising that followed is
    to degrade the dead, and to show that intelligent debate on a 
    difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview.  You
    clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of

    not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it, but had
    taken Gaza in a war that it did not start?  Did you know land
    Israel captures in wars, wars which other nations have ALWAYS
    started, aren't the same as Israel, and they are subject to a

    Where is this quote?  I have never heard Rabin assert that he
    wished such a thing.  Since you are in general a liar, you'll
    have to provide the entire quote, with source, or this effort
    will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications.



    Only you are led to ask such a loaded, racist, intellectually
    dishonest question.  You inability to come to terms with what
    you are has turned you into a racist of the highest order.



    Why do you not feel the same compassion for the Jews of Iran,
    or Iraq, or Yemen, or Saudi Arabia, or Syria?  Do you have an
    inkling of what they have endured over the past decades?  Or,
    what about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait?  Or what
    about the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims?  Do you think the
    residents of Gaza are being subjected to what all the Muslims 
    in Bosnia are enduring?  Why are you indifferent to the death
    and suffering of people?  Why do you not care that these folk
    are being exterminated?  Why do you not care that only Israel
    has given any of these people safe haven?  Could it be due to 
    the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing?  The
    people in Gaza are not being exterminated.  They aren't being
    killed.  They aren't being raped.  They aren't being starved.
    They aren't being driven from their lands.  They are not kept
    from receiving food or other supplies.  But the Bosnians are.
    And the ONLY country which has provided some sanctuary to the
    Bosnian Muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your 
    life to attacking, in the guise of compassion.    

    Your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual
    honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself
    what your real motives are.  Do not flatter yourself into the
    belief that truth or compassion are what drives you.  In your
    case, it is clear that hate beats out love every time.  Maybe
    you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born
    a Jew.  It is obvious that your hatred of your own Judaism is
    being dumped on all other Jews.  Why else would you suggest a
    racist idea like breeding Jews out of existence?  Maybe these
    fits of anti-semitism are a result of being cut off from your 
    own people for an extended period.  Whatever the case may be, 
    it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to

Drop three billiard balls on a ramp, and they all roll in the same
direction.  Pour some blood into the sea, and sharks will converge
from miles around.  Throw a pebble at one starling, and all 200 will
depart.

Natural processes can mimic the outward results of conspiracy when no
actual conspiracy is required.

Put a government functionary in an embarrassing situation, and he
quickly covers his ass.

This, too, is completely natural.


It looks that way to me, too.  But you have to understand that it's NOT 
the first time they have instigated raids like these.  The most recent
one ALSO ended up in a long standoff, but it wasn't quite as public
as this one, and they didn't kill quite as many people.  Maybe this 
screwup will make them think long and hard about raiding any more 
residences in this manner.  But probably not.

Feel free to patronize me all you like; I need the tips. :-)
Seriously, if you were insulted, I apologize.


People are sucking up to the government when they decide that ONLY the
things the government says are plausible.  Especially if they refuse to
consider reasonable alternatives.

However, from what I saw plastered all over the TV news last night, it's
no longer necessary to be an ""independent thinker"" to depart from the
government's party line.  It looks like our ""independent press"" may 
actually be starting to be earn its clothes allowance.  This, to me, is
a good sign.  I hope it continues.


Independent thinkers question authority.  In a situation where only one
set of facts are being presented, ""coming to a conclusion"" is not the 
hallmark of an independent thinker unless it's coupled with the ability
to challenge those ""facts"" critically.  The scientific method consists
of more than choosing the popular hypothesis; it's even more than choosing
between two hypotheses that other people have proposed.

Having lived, played, and worked on and near the Navajo reservation

Also, the Indians never stopped making rugs with this pattern - they
just stopped selling them after the Nazi's pre-empted the swastika.

counter-clockwise swastikas.

quest for more left-handed pitching.  So far, no takers.
Personally, I think Harris is a defensive liability, and he

plays, or at least been among the leaders.
 
Sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play
every day, he can get the job done.  If Sharpy played just
one base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively.
 
Wallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has Reed.
The improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an
effect on the pitching staff.  Both Astacio AND Martinez
were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays.
Martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might
have seen him lifted in the third in past years.
 
Astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances.
The Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls
in the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been great
on defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to
steal and has at least one pick off at first.
 
Wallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on

3632,"To those who are wondering what is happening in Minnesota:

  From what I have seen in the local news (TV and newspaper), various people 
in the area are trying to get a new hockey team.  A columnist for the St. 
Paul ""Pioneer Press"" wrote an article giving the ""inside scoop"" on the 
issue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible 
candiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic 
Center (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty 
confident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will 
ultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other 
two sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the 
inter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name) 
believes that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, 
because of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed 
until (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  
However, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, 
because the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for 
conventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to 
this mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future 
viability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even 
further.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of 
knocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging 
Minneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be
be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met, 
which may happen.
	Regarding possible candidates, the three teams are 
Hartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota ""
Ice Demons?"") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't 
been announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the 
Target Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in 
as many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see 
Hartford and Tampa show up there either.	So, Minnesota may end up 
getting another team, but it may take a few years.

Subject: Hebrew labor: racist connotations


AVODA IVRIT - HEBREW LABOR
---------------------------------

""Hebrew labor"" is a concept which has served the Zionist movement
for a long time.  It has a double-barreled message: 1) The new Jew
must learn to do physical labor, i.e. working the land; 2) The
land in this country must pass into Jewish hands, i.e. to the same
new Jew who has ""learned"" to work it. Both aspects of the
two-pronged concept of ""Hebrew labor"" have racist connotations. On
the one hand, the diaspora Jew's lack of training in physical
labor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites.  On the other
hand, its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the
Arab farmer from the source of his livelihood.

The occupation and the cheap Palestinian labor which streamed from
the occupied territories to the factories, orchards, and
hot-houses of Israel relegated the myth of ""Hebrew labor"" to the
history books and nostalgic memories of the Zionist Movement. It
has blossomed forth anew, however, as the government's answer to
problems caused by the closure of the territories. Today too this
concept has two functions: 1) to give a progressive look to the
closing of the Palestinian population.  Or in the words of
Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, ""I have no tears for those who
get rich off of cheap labor"". 2) to furnish an answer to the
unemployed Israeli who complains of being obliged to work for
wages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives.",3,talk.politics.mideast,"from: center for policy research <cpr> subject: hebrew labor: racist connotations avoda ivrit - hebrew labor --------------------------------- ""hebrew labor"" is a concept which has served the zionist movement for a long time . it has a double-barreled message: 1) the new jew must learn to do physical labor , i .e . working the land; 2) the land in this country must pass into jewish hands , i .e . to the same new jew who has ""learned"" to work it . both aspects of the two-pronged concept of ""hebrew labor"" have racist connotations . on the one hand , the diaspora jew's lack of training in physical labor is a myth shared by zionists and antisemites . on the other hand , its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the arab farmer from the source of his livelihood . the occupation and the cheap palestinian labor which streamed from the occupied territories to the factories , orchards , and hot-houses of israel relegated the myth of ""hebrew labor"" to the history books and nostalgic memories of the zionist movement . it has blossomed forth anew , however , as the government's answer to problems caused by the closure of the territories . today too this concept has two functions: 1) to give a progressive look to the closing of the palestinian population . or in the words of environment minister yossi sarid , ""i have no tears for those who get rich off of cheap labor"" . 2) to furnish an answer to the unemployed israeli who complains of being obliged to work for wages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives .",1550

Then allow me to enlighten you, Rex. You see, there's a thing called a tie. 
A tie is worth one point (I know, I know. You're not good at math. But bear

getting one win. If your team played two games, won one and lost one, you'd

 Hmmm...what about walks and SB? Baerga got clobbered by Alomar in OBP and

a player with a 51 point edge in OBP is more productive than a player with
a 28 point edge in SLG. The issue has been studied before, and I doubt you

A number of points.  You are making assumptions about the manner
in which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens,
and tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  For
citizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serves
on a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places,
is for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes place
in banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc...
Quite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card
for such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or
requirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public.
Furthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against
the bearer in any manner by having access to this information.

The only case that I can think of in which the Le'um field might
be taken into account is during interaction with the police,
based upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens are
clearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore
becomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field
is being used to discriminate against them officially.



I take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countries
do know that they have nothing to fear from ""Israeli expansionism"".
Militarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of
land under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a
sustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxing
the Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the
Awali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal
strip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire.
Public opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada
via territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from
battle fatigue of sorts and the gov't is aware of it.

With regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agree
with the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux
of the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating
a starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal
and a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders,
the negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state
smaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller
borders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be
settled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic
and sensible.


Your statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a ""center for
policy research"".  Whether or not all of Vanunu's revelations were true has no
bearing on the fact that some were.  For disclosing ""state secrets""
after having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that
said secrets are not to be made public, one should be punished.
As to which were and which weren't, I am under no moral obligation
to disclose that - quite the reverse in fact.
He was taken to court, tried, and found guilty.  You may take issue
with a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the
concept of ""Secrets of state"", something which every democratic govt
has.


I noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist
more than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted,
which you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no such
reports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill,
as tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was not
made public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would know
about it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be
made public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours.
This would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an
announcement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.


Well, I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted.  Such
questions are often termed ""tabloid journalism"" and are not
disturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity.
Such questions were often used during the McCarthy era as
a basis for the witch-hunts that took place then.  To use
your own example, these questions might have been lifted
from the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were looking
for small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray
as a larger and dirtier picture.

My answers were not any more ""hysterical"" than the questions
themselves.  The problem is not that the q's were provocative,
it was that they were selective in their fact seeking.  You
fall into the same category of those who seek ""yes"" ""no"" answers
when the real answer is ""of sorts"".
I suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an
unequivocal NO, you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete
them as you see fit.  A sign of strength is the ability to look

3370,"It was unlikely, improbable.  For the Bruins, it was the stuff of
nightmares; for the Sabres, it was a taste of heaven.  
   For the first time since 1983, the Sabres have won the first three
games of a series.  Last time was a three games to none victory in a
best of five against the Canadiens.  It takes a little more work this
time.  The Sabres seem ready to put in the extra work.
   On the heels of a shutout, one that took away Boston's home ice
advantage, the Sabres came back with a four to three overtime win.  It
wasn't easy.  It wasn't always pretty.  It still worked.
   John Blue got the nod for Boston, supplanting Andy Moog as starting
goaltender.  Moog was pulled midway through game 2 on Tuesday.
Buffalo started with a goal by Mogilny, his fourth of the playoffs, on
the powerplay, with Boston's Don Sweeney and Gord Roberts in the box.
LaFontaine and Hawerchuk had the assists.  Goal number two was
Khmylev's first of the playoffs, a pretty goal scored when the Sabres
stole the puck and passed to an open and waiting Khmylev.  Smehlik and
Hannan assisted.  Determined not to be shut out, Boston tallied on a
shot by Ray Bourque on the powerplay, with Colin Patterson and Bob
Sweeney both in the box.  Period two was scoreless, a split of
penalties between the two clubs.  The third saw Boston's Smolinski get
his first, courtesy of Oates.  Buffalo resecured the lead two minutes
later, from former Bruin Bob Sweeney (Khmylev and Carney).  Neely tied
the game 3/4 of the way through the third, sending it into overtime.
Last year overtime meant a Bruin win.  Last night, it spelled sweet
revenge, as Buffalo scored with Ray Bourque in the penalty box, on a
tip in by Khmylev (Hawerchuk and LaFontaine) a minute into overtime.
Both teams finished with 34 shots.  
        Power-play conversions--Boston 5-1. Buffalo 7-2.
        Referee--Rob Shick.

Comments:  Shick pocketed the whistle in the third, allowing a lot of
clutching and grabbing.  Buffalo's penalty killing unit was fantastic
again.  Mogilny was checking.  Granted he missed once and instead
flung his body into the boards, but checking like this is a novel idea
to Mogilny.  The crowd was unbelievable.  I don't think I've ever
heard a crowd that loud in the Aud for a Sabres game (remember, I was
only five when they played for the cup.  I don't remember it and no
one took me to the games).  Doug Bodger, in a postgame interview,
noted that he tried to say something to Hawerchuk, but the crowd was
too loud, even though he was shouting.  It didn't seem to matter, as
most of the Sabres and even Muckler said it was great.  Yuri Khmylev
didn't seem to realize that he was the game's third star and didn't
skate out when his name was called.  Sweeney (2) and Fuhr (1) each
were out before Yuri made his appearance, sans jersey.  When asked in
an interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was, he
responed yes (ok, it was through an interpreter and he said more than
that, even more than the interpreter said, but I digress).  The
interviewer seemed to think just because he doesn't speak English, he
must not understand playoffs.  Uh-huh.

It was Clint Malarchuk's neck cut by Uwe Krupp's skate.  I know it happened in
Buffalo, but I can't tell you against whom.

Krupp was defending an opposing attacker charging the net.

Malarchuk became the fourth goalie (behind Hasek, Puppa and Draper) after
suffering from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.  He's been playing in San Diego
for former Sabre coach Rick Dudley.

Krupp is now playing for the Islanders after the LaFontaine/Turgeon trade.

What do I win?  =)

I dunno about hat. I have friends up there on GEnie who are now saying that
Ottawa's gone soft on Daigle and is thinking hard about Pronger. Daigle has
shown an Attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne't liked,
and after coming back from his (second) multi-game suspension for being
stupid, he's really tanked in his performance. His stock is dropping like a
rock. 

Also remember that a lot of teh ""draft 1st"" stuff comes from the assumption
he'll be traded to Quebec for lots of prospects. It's not clear that 
Quebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current
status. He's still first round, but I don't consider him a first pick lock
by any means at this point.

It's also possible that the Senators are posturing to try to bring down his
signing price, since Daigle has been taking some Lindros lessons during thos
suspensions.



No. Kariya won't go in the first three, for a very simple reason: he's not
leaving college, and I don't believe ANY of the expansion teams are going to
use a first for someone who won't be around for another year or two, not
when there is equally good (or almost as good) stuff available that can make
an immediate impact. San jose seems to be leaning heavily towards
Niedermayer for that reason. Kariya could go 6th or 7th, unless a team can
convince him to leave school early (which I doubt).


My cut on things as they stand today:

	(it depends on if the Sharks can get a deal for him. I don't
	believe they draft him to keep him).

another message sponsored by the Department of Really Mundane Statistics:

I passed the final individual player stats posted here the other day through
a filter to average out games, goals, assists, points, and penalty minutes
for the mythical average NHL pro who played in the league this season. (Why?
Because it's Monday and I didn't feel like writing any REAL code...)

Anyway, after I wiped out the 60-odd goalies in the list, I came up with:

NHL average:		55 GP      11 G      19 A      30 Pts      69 PIM

Then I passed the list through a second time to come up with the players who
had the smallest percentage difference in each of the categories.

Marty McInnis (NYI)	56 GP (1%) 10 G (9%) 20 A (5%) 30 Pts (0%) 24 PIM (65%)
Igor Kravchuk (EDM)	55 GP (0%) 10 G (9%) 17 A (10%) 27 Pts (9%) 27 PIM (53%)

These two are close in games, goals, assists, and points, but are too far off
in PIM. This leaves, as the most average player in the NHL:

Bobby Carpenter (WAS)	65 GP (18%) 11 G (0%) 17 A (10%) 28 Pts (6%) 63 PIM (8%)

What an honor.

I also passed the list through with the goalies still included. Kravchuk and
Carpenter were still in the top three, but Rob DiMaio came flying up from 
behind to take the title:

I really don't understand all this!  I watched on satellite network feeds as  
perhaps 90 people died before my eyes, while the two Huey's fanned the flames,  
and the FBI stopped the firetrucks at the gate. 

Something was VERY wrong with that scene.

Perhaps if I'd watched RAMBO movies, I might've been dulled to the pain of  
fellow humans dying.

Thank GOD I still feel.  I'm very sorry for you who don't.  For you who think  
they got what they deserved.  Can you really believe that?  Even if Koresh was  
the sadistic mad man they said he was, did the others deserve his fate?   If,  
in fact, he was mad, wasn't that even more reason to believe he duped his  
followers, and therefore they were innocent, brainwashed, victims?  Is there  
any scenaro that justifies all that death?

And if not, it is clear that the deaths would not have occured if the BATF has  
not FUCKED UP initially, and now the FBI got impaitent and pushed Korech over  
the edge.

And that's if you buy the latest version of the ""story"" hook, line, and sinker.   
I have believed all along that they could not let them live, the embarrassment  
to the BATF and the FBI would've been too severe.

Remember, this was a suspicion of tax-evasion warrant.  There were no  
witnesses, except the FBI.  All information filtered through the FBI.  All they  
had to do was allow one remote controlled pool camera be installed near the  
building, and the press could've done their job, and would've been able to back  
the FBI's story with close up video, while incurring no risk to the press.   
Unless they did not want the public to see something.  The complete lack of any  
other source of information other than the FBI really causes me concern.

This was reported in Canadian papers Thursday, 22 April - I _think_ the
source was UPI, but don't recall for certain.



I understand that at least two goverment investigations have been ordered,
so we may learn more during their hearings. 


Tough call without more investigation, but if the thermal imaging story
holds up, I think the government will be more credable... of course,
paranoia fans won't believe their results anyway, will they?


Hear, hear! I'd also like to see the autopsy reports confirm news reports
that multiple victims were found shot (in the head), and in positions
inconsistent with fire victims. It is simply too early to draw conclusions
either way about this nasty incident, but I tend to believe the government
side.

2895,"Tigers' manager Sparky Anderson gets his 2,000th career win as moments ago,
the Tigers completed a two game sweep over the Oakland A's at Tiger Stadium
by beating the A's 3-2. Here are the highlights:


				R    H   E    
             Oakland		2    9   0
	     Detroit            3    7   1

Chad Krueter scored Skeeter Barnes from 1st with an RBI double in the 
bottom of the ninth against none other than Dennis Eckersley to give the
Tigers the victory.  Barnes also had an RBI single to score Thurmond to
tie the score in the ninth, also off Eckersley (sp?).

The A's got their runs on an RBI single by McGwire in the 1st and a solo
homer by Reuben Sierra in the 6th.  Deer doubled home Kirk Gibson in the
7th for the other Tiger run.

John Doherty pitched another strong game for the Tigers, once again lasting
through the seventh inning.  He was relieved by Bolton and then David Haas
in the 8th, and Haas got the win.  Bobby Witt started for the A's, and was
replaced by Honeycutt in the 6th, followed by Goose Gossage in the 8th, and
finally Eckersly in the 9th.  Doherty gave up both of the A's runs, while
Witt gave up the first Tiger run and Eckerseley gave up the last two.

In the post game interview (on WJR radio in Detroit), Sparky Anderson said
its one of the few times he's gotten emotional in his managing career.  It
was a big moment for him, and I'm sure all of us Tiger fans are unanimously
very happy for him.  And what a way to get number 2,000!.

I agree that Keenan is an excellent choice.  Did you see Mike
Lupica's column in Sunday's news?  My sentiments exactly.  I
think he just may be the one to instill some hunger and fire
into their hearts next season.  Either that or he's going to 
be kicking alot of butt!


I'm here, but am new to this group and have been keeping fairly
quiet (you know, doing the ""lurking"" thing).  I don't have a
sense how many Rangers fans there are on the list either.  I 
am a die-hard Ranger fan (I guess I have to be - I sat in the
Garden throughout the Penguins' - led by Mario's 5 goals - decimation 
of them on 4/9), but am sick at the abundance of talent that has
been totally untapped, and the lack of heart displayed this
season.


Hurlbut was injured for quite a while.  I'm not sure, but I
think he may have recovered in time for the playoff run, and
if so, like you, question why he wasn't used.


I believe Kocur was used, in many instances, for his intimidation 
factor.  Granted, he seemed to get an awful lot of ice time for 
that reason alone, but you have to realize that when a team is
not doing any REAL physical intimidation (I'd like to have a nickel 
for every time J.D. said 'They've got to take the body more'), 
you've got to at least have some illusions ;-(


I agree and I don't know.


Sorry, I don't agree with you here.  I think Joey C. did a good
job filling in when he was asked to.  I can't imagine that it's
easy going from near 0 ice time to being a full timer.  I don't
seem to remember him turning the puck over at the blue line too
much, or failing to clear the zone.  He worked hard, and at
least didn't make any rookie mistakes.  As he said himself in an
interview, he can only give what he has.  and he did.  


Absolutely.  I think attendance at the Garden was better on the
last day of the season, than any average night for the
Islanders.


The man is awesome.  In a way, I'm enjoying the playoffs more,
now that the Rangers aren't in them.  I can really appreciate
all the glory Mario is getting without 'hating' him because he's
on the opposing team.  He deserves it all, as far as I'm
concerned.

I would appreciate it if someone could volunteer to verify the shots on goal
and save percentage numbers for me, so I can put these stats on the archive
site.  Contact me by mail if you want to volunteer.

Here are the individual goalie stats as of: Wed Apr 21 09:09:38 CST 1993

These stats include games up to and including the Sunday previous to the date
listed above.  They have been verified against what is printed in my newspaper
every Tuesday.  They don't print shots and save percentage numbers, so those
are not verified.  These stats are available by mail every weekday and
sometimes on weekends, if I'm in town and I can get late game results.  Just
send me a note if you would like to receive these stats by mail.

If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, let me know.

I lived there until July 1992 so I think that on the whole,
my input is relevant.


Those are two separate questions.  Obviously, Israeli authorities do
recognize Israeli nationality for some purposes, e.g. passports,
consular services, etc...  ID cards have a field of nationality
which is a subdivision of the above.  Ostensibly, this field
is provided for sevices provided by the religious departments
of the gov't, though this is not the general case.


From its onset, Israel's borders have been shaped and reshaped by both
war and peace.  As such, the Israeli gov't has always felt that defining
its borders is a step that is meaningful only after peace treaties have
been conluded with its neighbors.  There is no plan for ""ultimate borders""
(is this a game like ""ultimate frisbee""?) extending into  other countries.


Aside from what Vaanunu provided, no.


If that is true, then by virtue of the question's subject, it is
unanswerable.  Anyone who claims its validity. is claiming an oxymoron.
That having been said, I deny the above.

You go on to ask quite a number of questions that show an obvious
bias.  Questions of the sort ""Is it true that you entered your
mother's vagina?"" which are based upon some kernel of truth, though
phrased in a way as to render them repugnant and cast aspersions
upon Israel.  Incidentally, the answer to the above is usually yes,
unless you were born via a C-section.

  Note the clause ""more forcibly"", above.     My point is that they have
  made a few pro-forma, perfunctory remarks, and sent in a few C-130's and
  so forth, but it's clearly not something they're losing much sleep over.
  They're just going through the motions, while Moslems are being ""ethnically

  Precisely.   Humanitarian concerns were not the primary justification

1.  Enforce the two minutes between innings.  As it is, many fields are
    allowing THREE minutes between them.  Fifteen seconds before 
    TV commercials are gone to, Thirty or so before action begins upon
    the return to the game.  Two minutes, last out to first pitch, or
    a ball is called.

2.  Don't grant time to batters just because they want it.  They may get
    pissed at first, but they'll get in line, once anything the pitcher
    throws while they're adjusting their wristbands is a strike.

3.  Mandate a rule permitting only N seconds between pitches (the current
    rule is too lenient), and then enforce it.  Fifteen seconds is more
    than enough time.  If the pitch isn't released in 15, call it a ball,
    and restart the clock.

Baseball games take about 2:51 in the NL, and just a shade under 3 hours
in the AL.  That's just too damn long.  I don't like to PLAY in 3 hour
games, much less WATCH a game for that long.  My butt falls asleep, and
if I'm watching on TV, I'll channel surf between pitches, catching

Ein Jude an die zionistischen Kaempfer - 1988

    von Erich Fried

Was wollt ihr eigentlich ?  Wollt ihr wirklich die uebertreffen
die euch niedergetreten haben vor einem Menschenalter in euer
eigenes Blut und in euren eigenen Kot ?

Wollt ihr die alten Foltern jetzt an andere weitergeben mit allen
blutigen dreckigen Einzelheiten mit allem brutalen Genuss die
Folterknechte wie unsere Vaeter sie damals erlitten haben ?

Wollt jetzt wirklich ihr die neue Gestapo sein die neue Wehrmacht
die neue SA and SS und aus den Palaestinensern die neuen Juden
machen ?

      *

Aber dann will auch ich weil ich damals vor fuenfzig Jahren selbst
als ein Judenkind gepeinigt wurde von euren Peinigern ein neuer
Jude sein mit diesen neuen Juden zu denen ihr die Palaestinenser
macht

       *

Und ich will sie zurueckfuehren helfen als freie Menschen in ihr
eigenes Land Palaestina aus dem ihr sie vertrieben habt oder in
dem ihr sie quaelt ihr Hakenkreuzlehrlinge ihr Narren und
Wechselbaelge der Weltgeschichte denen der Davidstern auf euren
Fahnen sich immer schneller verwandelt in das verfluchte Zeichen

This is certainly not the case.  There is no significant *ability* toi
perform in the clutch, but clutch performance certainly happens every
time there is a game-winning hit.  The ""clutch pitching"" quoted above is
something which happened, not a claim that any particular player should
be expected to be a clutch pitcher.



Simple statistics tell me that there is a 2% chance an average clutch
hitter would have this large a split (the average decrease is 7 points,
standard deviation about 30).  There will be such hitters in any league,
just as there will be hitters who hit poorly on Tuesdays.

And there is only a very weak correlation (.01 in my best study) between
clutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year,
probably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather
than any ability.  *Based only on this data*, I don't see any reason to
pinch-hit for Sabo, or any other player who had been a poor clutch
hitter in the past.

But there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinch-hit.
Does the pinch-hitter give you a platoon advantage?  (Any portion of
Sabo's clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a
real ability, even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting.)  Do you
have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run?  Do you
have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves?

RTw  12/23 0859  GULF ARABS DEMAND IRAN WITHDRAWAL FROM ISLANDS 

 (Eds: updates with end of summit details, quotes) 
    By Youssef Azmeh 
    ABU DHABI, Dec 23, Reuter - Gulf Arab states, emerging from a summit
that restored 
their unity after almost three months of crisis, piled pressure on Iran
on Wednesday to 
reverse its virtual annexation of a strategic Gulf island. 
    They issued a statement after a three-day Gulf Cooperation Council
summit saying Iran 
had to show proof of its good neighbourly intentions by rescinding
measures that ""rocked 
Gulf stability and security."" 
    The leaders avoided the anti-Iranian rhetoric of recent statements
by Egypt, which 
engineered a last minute settlement of a border row between Saudi Arabia
and Qatar that 
allowed all members to attend the summit. 
    Egypt said its fears about Iranian intentions in the region and
Tehran's alleged 
encouragement of Moslem fundamentalist unrest were largely behind
President Hosni 
Mubarak's mediation. 
    The GCC statement stressed that developing relations between the
Gulf Arab states and 
Iran ""is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take
in line with its 
commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of
the sovreignty and 
territorial integrity of the region's states."" 
    It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa, which it
shares with the 
United Arab Emirates, and the continued occupation of the Greater and
Lesser Tumbs 
islands. 
    Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a
small garrison it 
established there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah. 
    It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the
island for the 
UAE government. But diplomats say it continues to exercise its authority
over the whole 
island, which the UAE sess as as virtual annexation. 
    The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and the
UAE has since the 
Abu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part
of a general 
settlement. 
    The GCC leaders called on the U.N. to maintain sanctions against
Iraq for not fully 
implementing Security Council resolutions following its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. 
    They endorsed once again the ""Damascus Declaration,"" a pact signed
with Egypt and 
Syria after their troops took part in the U.S. led alliance that drove
Iraqi troops out of 
Kuwait. 
    But delegates said the leaders were unable to agree the details of a
fund they 
announced they would create at their last summit in Kuwait last year
which would have 
helped Egypt's and Syria's economic development programme. 
    They said the leaders could not agree on a breakdown of
contributions from each state 
although the total amount had been scaled down to $6 billion from the
$10 billion agreed 
last year. 
    The fact that the leaders of all GCC states -- Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and 
Qatar -- attended the summit was seen as a major achievement although
their unity was only 
maintained with outside help. 
    Most delegations were not too worried for the moment about the slow
progress of the 
conservative rulers discussions on a future security structure for the
region that boasts 
the bulk of global oil and gas reserves. 
    The leaders were unable to choose between two proposals. 
    One put forward by a summit committee headed by Oman's Sultan Qaboos
to create a 
100,000-man rapid deployment force that could rush to defend any member
against external 
aggression, such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
    Another was a Saudi-supported plan to expand the existing 10,000-man
""Peninsula 
Shield"" force which had so far played a largely symbolic role and is
commanded by a Saudi 
general. 
    Little headway was made on plans for a reginal common market
although the summit 
called for concrete proposals to be submitted to next year's summit due
to be held in 
Saudi Arabia next December.

RTw  12/23 0835  GULF LEADERS END SUMMIT 

    ABU DHABI, Dec 23, Reuter - Gulf Arab states ended a three-day
annual summit on 
Wednesday with an appeal to Iran to end its occupation of three
strategic Gulf islands as 
a condition for restoring friendly ties across the Gulf. 
    A joint statement issued after the summit, marked by relief over the
settlement of a 
row between two Gulf Cooperation Council members, also called for
continued U.N. sanctions 
against Iraq. 
    It said Baghdad had failed to implement key Security Council
decisions following the 
expulsion of its troops from Kuwait early last year. 
    The summit broke no new ground on steps to achieve a Gulf common
market, but called on 
officials to present a plan for common external tarrifs for all six
members to the next 
summit which will be held in Saudi Arabia in December 1993. 
    The statement stressed that developing relations between the Gulf
Arab states and Iran 
""is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take in
line with its 
commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of
the sovreignty and 
territorial integrity of the region's states."" 
    It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa, which it
shares with the 
United Arab Emirates, and the continued occupation of the smaller
islands, the Greater and 
Lesser Tumbs. 
    It expressed deep regret and extreme concern for the unjustified
Iranian measures 
which contradict a proclaimed wish to develop relations and called on
Iran to rescind 
those measures and end the occupation which it said was ""shaking peace
and stability in 
the area."" 
    Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a
small garrison it 
established there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah. 
    It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the
island for the 
UAE government but diplomats in the region say that its security forces
continue to 
exercise their authority over the whole island. 
    The UAE has seen this as virtual annexation. 
    The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and the
UAE has since the 
Abu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part

RTw  12/26 1441  IRAN HINTS IT READY TO GO TO WAR OVER ISLANDS 

 (Eds: updates with SNSC statement) 
    NICOSIA, Dec 26, Reuter - Iran told its Gulf Arab neighbours on
Saturday it was ready 
to defend militarily three disputed islands, reminding them of its
eight-year war with 
Iraq. 
    ""Our eight-year defence (in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war) has proved to
the world that 
our brave nation will never hesitate to defend the sovereignty and
safeguard the 
territorial integrity of Iran,"" Iran's Supreme National Security Council
(SNSC) said. 
    A meeting of the heads of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council
voiced full support 
on Wednesday for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in its dispute with Iran
over the Gulf 
islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb. 
    The move has triggered strong Iranian criticism and warnings.
Besides the UAE, the GCC 
also groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. 
    Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who chaired the SNSC's
meeting on 
Saturday, said during his Friday prayer sermon at Tehran University:
""Iran is surely 
stronger than the likes of you. To reach these islands one has to cross
a sea of blood."" 
    The SNSC, quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA received
in Cyprus, also 
criticised the GCC and described its support of the UAE as ""irresponsible."" 
   ""No country will ever be able to covet even an inch of Iranian soil,""
said the SNSC. 
    Earlier on Saturday, the English language Tehran Times, believed to
be close to the 
Foreign Ministry, said the UAE should be aware that Iran's
self-restraint had certain 
limits. 
    It dismissed a UAE claim to the islands as unfounded and said a 1971
agreement to 
share Abu Musa with the UAE emirate of Sharjah still applied. 
    ""The idea of Abu Dhabi officials that Tehran would always refrain
from responding to 
the blows inflicted by them was ""childish,"" Tehran Times said. 
    IRNA said the newspaper was commenting on the GCC statement which
urged Iran to 
reverse what it says is the annexation of Abu Musa island and to pull
out of the two other 
islands. 
    Iran says the islands near the entrance to the Gulf have
historically belonged to it. 
The dispute flared this year after Iran tightened its control over Abu Musa.

""our eight-year defence (in the 1980-88 iran-iraq war) has proved to the world that our brave nation will never hesitate to defend the sovereignty and safeguard the territorial integrity of iran ,"" iran's supreme national security council (snsc) said . a meeting of the heads of the six-nation gulf cooperation council voiced full support on wednesday for the united arab emirates (uae) in its dispute with iran over the gulf islands of abu musa , greater tumb and lesser tumb . the move has triggered strong iranian criticism and warnings . besides the uae , the gcc also groups bahrain , kuwait , oman , qatar and saudi arabia . iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , who chaired the snsc's meeting on saturday , said during his friday prayer sermon at tehran university: ""iran is surely stronger than the likes of you . to reach these islands one has to cross a sea of blood ."" the snsc , quoted by the official iranian news agency irna received in cyprus , also criticised the gcc and described its support of the uae as ""irresponsible ."" ""no country will ever be able to covet even an inch of iranian soil ,"" said the snsc . earlier on saturday , the english language tehran times , believed to be close to the foreign ministry , said the uae should be aware that iran's self-restraint had certain limits . it dismissed a uae claim to the islands as unfounded and said a 1971 agreement to share abu musa with the uae emirate of sharjah still applied . ""the idea of abu dhabi officials that tehran would always refrain from responding to the blows inflicted by them was ""childish ,"" tehran times said . irna said the newspaper was commenting on the gcc statement which urged iran to reverse what it says is the annexation of abu musa island and to pull out of the two other islands . iran says the islands near the entrance to the gulf have historically belonged to it . the dispute flared this year after iran tightened its control over abu musa . reuter af jch rtw 12/28 1011 tehran paper wants iran revive claim to bahrain",8474

   Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area.  It would not
   be economic to smuggle them in.  All production would have to be
   local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill
   AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.
   High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but
   the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun
   - and would pay through the nose for it.

Good point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude,
homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate
fire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall
the tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for
use by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of
effective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means of
killing German soldiers for their guns.

Also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the Sten gun, was
specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible.
The point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel
tubing, hand tools and a welder.

I still think that while the point is good, I think there's a difference
between marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grown
locally; there's no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, I
think the demand for ""real"" guns will be sufficient to make smuggling
economically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case, the
result would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't have
firearms, and ""bad guys"" will continue to have access to them, one way

So far, you have presented your opinions as opposed to mine. I would
hardly take them as facts.



I could give you hundreds of words in my mother tongue (Spanish), that
are comonly use and you will never find in a dictionary. Even more, I
could show you a lot of meanings that words in Spanish have different
from those in the dictionary.


And guess why. Isn't it curious that we do not know how many people define 
in how many different ways the term Jew, which is the basis of the movement 
itself?
So, the evidence shows that up to now, Jew, when considered in terms of Israel,
the Law of Return and Jewish Nationality is defined in terms of religion and
not of cultural identity, even if 80% of those defined as Jews in Isreal
are not religious.



That IS a problem. I am saying that I do not support Zionism as it is
now. I believe that among the people in the Soviet Communist Party some
might even had been inspired by noble ideals. Does that change the
final results of what happened in the USSR?
In the same way, even if the Zionist movement is not homogeneous, it
does not matter. What matters is the result.


I never said it directly nor indirectly. I am not talking about individuals
who defined themselves as zionists here. I am sure most of them are good,
honest and caring people. I am talking about the results of the Zionist
Movement. I am talking about a Movement whose actions resulted in a
Law of Return with a religious definition of Jew, a country that defines
nationality based on religion. I am talking about something I consider
a form of racism such as differenciation based on religious belief. 
After all, if Arabs in Israel cannot serve in the Army is becasue they 
were not born in the ""right"" religion.


I had never heard the definition: Only those who are religious are defined as Jews.
I had always seen the definition: A person is a Jew is his/her mother is/was
a Jew, and if such person does not convert, although I had seen people
argue about the last part.


So, there is no difference between citizenship and nationality in Israel?
Or what do you mean by ""Actually, it doesn't""?


So, it follows a religious definition and not a cultural one. That is what
I call a form of racism.


You do not need to assume the representation of ""everybody else"" to 
make your points. You should assume that you are just talking for yourself.
About the other stuff, I still believe that the example was a valid one.
It would be a hypocrisy to say that one supports nationalism for all and
then support Zionism and then disregard the Palestinian's right.


It was an example. You are trying to justify something nobody has 
talked about.



Reference.


yes, but not all of them. A language is something that evolves all the time.


Not really. I posted in another post the definition of Zionism. And, in
this post you have showed for me what I was telling you from the 
begining. Zionism is a form of racism, even if most zionists are not
racist in their individual and private lifes. A movement that ask
for a State and National rights for a people, and then in practice,
that people are defined according to religion is, for me, racist-like.


You did it. Next time be more careful.

I would change one of the many parts that define my cultural identity.
If I loose a leg, it might change my personality, but I do not
stop being a human being. 
Even more, when someone gets a baboon heart, that person is still
human.


Not really. That is what differenciates agnostics from atheists.
As an atheist, I do not believe there is a god, nor do I believe that
there ever was one.
So, those commandments have no meaning to me. Also, there are a lot
of ideas that have no meaning to me: The idea of a chosen people,
the idea of a given right to the land of Israel, the idea of keeping
kosher, the idea of opposing intermarriage, the idea of having a 
Torah that was inspired by god, etc. 
By being an atheist, I cannot support the idea of the Jewish Nation
as defined by a religious principle or based on a religious identity.
For me, religion is just another piece in what constitutes the cultural
identity of the Jewish people. I believe that as a people with a 
cultural identity they constitute a Nation and have the same right as
any other people in the world to have their own State. The same right
as the Armenians have, as the Palestinians have, as the French have,
and as anybody else have.
I cannot say that by accepting a different god someone has lost all 
cultural identification.

[IC] There are some Armenians here, in the USA.

[IC] Suppose, a large group of people of one of such area decides,
[IC] that the US ""government is not representing their interests, and vote for
[IC] seperation"" from the USA.

The Armenians you refer to have chosen to come to the United States lawfully 
and peacefully. However, if Armenians invade the United States and force
Americans to either flee or become Armenians, it will not succeed. Similarly,
the Armenians of Karabakh are being forced by Azerbaijan to either become 
Azeris or leave, and it also will not succeed, as has been demonstrated. 

Karabakh, irrespective of its geographic position situated technically within
the Stalin-prepared borders of Azerbaijan, has been long oppressed and 
eventually was invaded in 1991 by Azeri OMON and Soviet forces, resulting in 
the northern third of this Armenian area being depopulated of Armenians. The 
Armenians have been fighting back ever since. 

Clearly, you feel it rather ridiculous for Armenians, of let's say Glendale, 
California, to engage in an independence movement for a free and independent
Glendale. Similarly, the Azerbaijanis are engaging in a losing attempt at
claiming sovereignty over the land and people of Karabakh, who have lived
continuously in Karabakh a thousand years before the first Central Asian 
invaders ever stepped foot in the Caucasus. 

[IC] Should they get it? 
[IC] And should the UN enforce their will?
[IC] And is it a simple, beautiful concept, indeed?

Your analogy has broken down because you have switched positions of the victim
and invader. A better analogy would be the direct parallel between Armenians 
of Karabakh and Native Americans. Now, if you wish, we can discuss the tenets 
of might versus right and the policies of settler nations!

408,"Excerpts from netnews.talk.politics.guns: 18-Apr-93 2ND AMENDMENT DEAD -
GOOD ! by jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu 

excerpted from a letter I wrote a while ago:

     Although less apparent to those who have not researched
the facts, personal protection is as legitimate a reason  as
sport for the private citizen to own a gun.  The most recent
research  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State
University  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns
are  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by
criminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in
this  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when
you  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because
of  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding
private  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study
of  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39%
of  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime
because  they believed that the intended victim was  armed.,
and  57% agreed that ""most criminals are more worried  about
meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the
police.""2
     One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the
women  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observation
that  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in
response  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   This
should be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando
Florida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960's  the  female
populace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just
the  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and
obtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for
that  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to
experience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally,
a 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapes
showed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion
rate  is 36%. But when a woman defends herself with  a  gun,
the completion rate drops to 3%.

While it may mean that in 1993, the relevant meaning comes from 1789.
Moreover, ""controlled"" doesn't tell you WHO's doing the controllling.

Fletcher's Political Works, pub'd in 1749, defines a ""well-regulated
militia"", that being the relevant phrase, as being an armed people NOT
under the control of govt.  The wigged gents who argued about the
constituion used it in that way.

Feel free to provide a 1790s-era reference showing a usage other than
""individual right, not to be interfered with by govt"".

Note that the first clause has a meaning - it is a restriction on
govt military power.  See Scarry's University of Penn law review
article for an extended discussion.  The existence of a well-regulated
militia is a necessary part of that restriction, but it is not sufficient.

My votes (FWIW):

Team MVP: Pat Verbeek. He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has 
36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain
throughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and
Mark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than
MVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on
the team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess
I place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.

Biggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season
as a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+
points. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming
from the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew
Cassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and
Petrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23
and will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the
role of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake
bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put
up about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started
performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, 
although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the
right side.

Biggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77
point season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started
the season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,
since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).
Cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded
the powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his
way out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left
to run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the 
Maple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar
after signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of
competence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better
hockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only

Matching the Makarov offer was the only real mistake Dave King has made this

is obviously on the downside of his career to a 4-year $2 million contract. 
Risebrough matched the offer on King's request and Makarov has spent the last
quarter of the season in the press box because his work ethic just plain
stinks. Not to mention that he's lost a step and can no longer get himself
into position to make the nifty passes. 

I think Makarov will be available for free this offseason to anybody who agrees
to pay his contract. He's ineffective in Calgary, but he might be able to help
a team like San Jose, with their shortage of talent. If there's no takers, and
Makarov doesn't show improvement in training camp, I think the Flames will just
bite the bullet and buy out Makarov's contract and release him. With his

All your article reflects is your abundant ignorance. The people of 
Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never 
abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally 
hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the
parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole 
perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July 
15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop 
Makarios.

Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with 
the aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right 
given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently 
and conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For 
those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island 
since 1571. 

The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization
of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the
'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not
forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks
in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to
destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of
course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences 
for this irresponsible conduct.


            THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM

2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus

It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at
the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched
against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat
Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally
killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage
Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the
24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities
committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which
has been converted into a museum.

AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY
GREEK TERRORISTS

The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the
Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been
going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men
and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal
Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage
bloodshed...

The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a
major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent,
are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the
bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their
home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.

Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by
Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded
during the same terrible event.

""On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan
and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan.
Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs.
Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting
having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River
direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain.
Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was
dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought
would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in
the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We
waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing
in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her
arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.
Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house
with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard
voices saying, in  Greek, ""You want Taksim eh!""  and then bullets
started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children
fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks,
who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I
heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.

When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and
her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the
neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what
had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to
the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was
brutally murdered.

In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying
""Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?""  I became terrified. I
thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not
dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself
under the double-bed.

An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My
mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some
water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the
bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I
offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who
were all wounded.

We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I
thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed
to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber
and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked
as far as Koshklu Chiftlik.

There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were
operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there
were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.
Ayshe and her daughter.

After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to
Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months
treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus,
Greeks arrested me at the Airport.

All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my
detention. They then released me.""

ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER

We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in
which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five
days.

We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some
terrible sights.

In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way
into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A
child's bicycle lay in a corner.

In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three
children piled on top of their murdered mother.

In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the
head.

This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose
family had been killed by the mob in the first violence.

Today was five days later, and still they lay there.

children murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer...""

 THEY ARE TURK-HUNTING, THEY WANT TO EXTERMINATE THEM.

 Discussions start in London; in Cyprus terror continues. Right now we
 are witnessing the exodus of Turks from the villages. Thousands of people
 abandoning homes, land, herds; Greek Cypriot terrorism is relentless. This 
 time, the rhetoric of the Hellenes and the bust of Plato do not suffice to 
 cover up barbaric and ferocious behaviors.

 DAILY HERALD (London)

 AN APPALLING SIGHT

And when I came across the Turkish homes they were an appalling sight.
Apart from the walls, they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm bomb
attack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick
and concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately
fired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twisted
mass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey
ashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes.

In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16 
wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. From
this village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither village
did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house.


 DAILY TELEGRAPH (London)
 
 GRAVES OF 12 SHOT TURKISH CYPRIOTS FOUND IN CYPRUS VILLAGE

 Silent crowds gathered tonight outside the Red Crescent hospital in the
 Turkish Sector of Nicosia, as the bodies of 9 Turkish Cypriots found
 crudely buried outside the village of Ayios Vassilios, 13 miles away, were
 brought to the hospital under the escort of the Parachute Regiment. Three 
 more bodies, including one of a woman, were discovered nearby but could
 not be removed. Turkish Cypriots guarded by paratroops are still trying to 
 locate the bodies of 20 more believed to have been buried on the same site.

	That's OK -- you can mail me if you want more discussion.


	Around here, long-guns are proof of age and fill out the forms.
For pistols, nation-wide check for felonies and three days wait.  The
""good reason"" is the difference, and one Americans tend to get annoyed
over as we see no reason the guy with the badge is any better than us.


	Not when dealing with America.  I can drive an 18-wheel truck
with no permit, no license, and at age 12 if I'm engaged in farming
work.  Strange, that, but there is little to no problem with this.
Again, personal rights versus collective security.


	Strange that the rates would decline, since killing somebody
is much more frowned upon than merely stealing a gun.


	Why attract attention?  I carry my sword openly to and from
practice, as that is the only legal thing I can do.  I also attract
a lot of attention doing this.  I'd rather be lost ""in a crowd of one""
than be the subject of attention while carrying a weapon.  Think of
the word ""intimidation"" and you can see where intimidation is not
the preferable method for the normal citizen.


	Aggressive towards whom?  Southerners?  Germans?  Precisely
why I think your society is less violent, weapons aside.


	Then the masses have the same rights as the individuals, because
everything comes down to the individual in one instance or another.  To
draw an analogy, Norway is involved in the EEC.  The USA in involved in
NATO.  The EEC requires certain changes in your laws.  NATO requires
no such changes in USA law.  These laws affect citizens, and hence
Norway is saying Europe is more important than, say, Norwegians having
motorcycles that make over 100bhp.  In the USA, we'd likely tell the
EEC to get stuffed since the EEC has no business, in our eyes, in
telling us how much horsepower we can safely ride.  While I note
that our own state governments often play with game with the federal
government, in essence this is a cultural difference between us.


	It shouldn't.  Since neither of our countries has managed to
remove criminals from society, in America we feel (and remember we
have individual states that are larger than your country) that if the
police cannot protect us then we must do so ourselves.  The criminals
in our country are quite violent, hence we prepare for them.


	We don't.  E-mail me to find out just how difficult it really
is in this country.  It is easier than in yours, but theft is far
easier than the troubles we go through to purchase over here.


	They are neither.  They are an option.  We would never force
you to own guns if you lived here.  We would, however, fight to keep
that option open to you.


	Then you show you are a responsible, rational user of weapons.
Welcome to our ranks.  Now, how do we teach the young people this sort
of responsibility?  Cultures seem to have a grave impact here.

What a dope!  There is no value for Mohammed Elabdellaoui to be here
at a Western University.  Third-worldist and Islamic brain-rot has
made it impossible for him to acquire and analyze facts appropriately.

The history of the efforts of the Mufti of Jerusalem to serve the
Nazis in the South Balkans and set up Muslim SS Divisions is
well-documented.  In general, Nazism and the leader-principle
resonated well among Muslim peoples.  Khomeini's concept of the faqih
is a recent example of such resonance.  In fact, totalitarianism is
etymologically a reasonable translation Islam.

To be fair, the Mufti did not succeed in getting large numbers of
Muslims to join the SS.  But the rather small Muslim SS unit did
manage to commit attrocities disproportionate to it size.  There were
also Muslim people who were less than enthusiastic about the attempt
of Muslim leaders to entice Muslim people to serve the Nazi cause
actively.  And the Turkish government ignored practically all Nazi
overtures even though an alliance with the Nazis against the Soviet
government would have made a great deal of tactical sense.

Yes, the typical primitive Muslim psychopathological psychotic
behavior upon hearing or reading a disagreeable fact -- start whining

I wonder why you say that?  I don't see why having a spouse and/or
kids would have anything to do with it.  It might if you brought
your kids to the game and wanted them to get home in time to get
to bed at a reasonable hour (in which case I'd probably decide
to take my kids to games on weekends, as many people do, or else
be prepared to leave the game early), but from what you say later
on, you don't bring your kids *or* your spouse to the game.
As it happens, I have a husband but no kids, and my husband usually
attends games with me.


I can see it's a problem if you don't bring your wife to the ballgame,
but that's a problem even if the game goes a trim 2 1/2 hours.  As far
as bagging work the next day, I don't really understand why that's
necessary, unless going to a game also means that you consume vast
quantities of beer (I note that this is the case for many guys).
If you don't think you can get up to go to work after a long evening
out, then don't have long evenings out during the week.


Look: if I pay between $8.00 and $20.00 apiece for tickets, plus $10.00 
for parking, plus spending my time and energy driving to and from Boston, 
plus spending additional money on concessions etc. at the ballpark, then 
I see going to a game as a considerable investment of time and money.
I can't afford to go to a lot of games.  Hence, going to a game is a
big deal, like going to a play or an opera.  Maybe you have more money than 
I do and can go to games all year long, so it's not such a big deal for you.  
But I'm not interested in having games ""sped up"", any more than I want to
have _Die Walkure_ cut down to a convenient ""weeknight version"" of two
hours.  If I felt that going to a night game during the week would interfere 
with my family life or my work life, then I'd choose to go to a weekend game.

May I suggest you chech out the _Palestinian National Covenant (1964)_.  It may
not use the exact words as quoted above but I'm sure many will agree that the
same message is being issued.  Later on when I get back home I will try to find
the precise section(s) but you can do the research for now (I hope).  I also
realize that Yasser Arafat renounced the _Covenant_ *to the Western media only*
but he has yet to inform the PNC officially and enequivocally of his exact
intentions on this issue.  Therefore, as far as we are concerned the _Covenant_
still stands as the ""Bible"" (so to speak) of the mainstream Palestinian
National movement!



As a staunch pro-Israel activist I can confidently say that Bnai Brith has NOT
influenced my opinions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  As I mentioned above,
just a little research on the subject will lead anyone to reach a similar
conclusion on the Palestinian National movement (the PLO in most cases).  BB
does not properly speak for me nor many of the people around me who share
my views.


What 1948 situation?  A negative situation I presume?  Is this the same
""situation"" when the Jordanian occupiers of East Jerusalem would not allow the
Jews to go worship at the HOLIEST SITE IN JUDIASM?  Was this an example of
Qu'ranic law being exercised?  If not, I have another suggested reading for
you... get into the ""soc.culture.arabic"" newsgroup where the posters have been
debating the topic ""Jews in the Qu'ran"" (and may I remind you the people doing
the debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu'ran).
You will find that Jews aren't really viewed positively by the Qu'ran (to put
it lightly).  So how do you think Jews (or any other non-Islamic religion) will
be treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu'ran?  I think
the 1948-1967 ""situation"" in Jerusalem will return *at best*!  What do you
think?


All I have to say to that is, once again, see s.c.a - ""Jews in the Qu'ran"" and
think again.  ""Freedom of choice"" is *definitely* not an option in Qu'ranic
law especially for non-Muslims and ALL women!  Remember the Gulf War?  I'm sure
you saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia (an Islamic
state).


Probably nothing!  Aside from how to break the news to his Palestinian brethren
that the _Covenant_ is ""null and void"" without getting assassinated himself!


In conclusion, Ahmed, you should go to the library and find the _Palestinian
National Covenant (1964)_ and read it VERY CAREFULLY.  By the way, Redpath
Library DOES have it in stock because that is exactly where I found it when I
was doing my research.  So enjoy the reading and I hope we will be hearing back
from you soon!

But whatever the neutrons hit has a good chance of absorbing the
neutron and becoming radioactive itself. Mostly, that means water
turning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would 
also hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives
would remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear
warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.

As for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince
is required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in
a dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private
ownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must
be able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe
condition. If any random private citizen could not properly
keep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation
is clearly appropriate.



I disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend
themselves and their community. If you look at the American 
revolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves
from, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They
didn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for 
example) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same
old regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and
destroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate.
But their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited
for that.

There is also the question of personal and collective arms: The
Second Amendment definately protects ownership of personal
weapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members
to provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers
other arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example)
a tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)
should. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a 
disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.
The militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely
democratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only
50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would
be proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular
will were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the
members supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the
form of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's
firepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not
of the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite
different from the general public (at the very least, they
would be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and
character of the militia requires that each member provide
a roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal
weapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.",2,talk.politics.guns,"but whatever the neutrons hit has a good chance of absorbing the neutron and becoming radioactive itself . mostly , that means water turning into (harmless) heavy water . but some neutrons would also hit bones , and the resulting harmfull , secondard radioactives would remain in the body for decades . i think an unshielded nuclear warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard . as for a shielded warhead , i think a fair amount of maintaince is required for it to remain safely shielded (e .g . storage in a dry , temperature-regulated facility , etc . . .) for private ownership to be unregulated , i think a single individual must be able not only to keep the weapon , but keep it in a safe condition . if any random private citizen could not properly keep , maintain and store a nuclear weapon , then some regulation is clearly appropriate . i disagree with this purpose: the job of the militia is to defend themselves and their community . if you look at the american revolution as an example , the militias won by seperating themselves from , and becoming independent of , a repressive government . they didn't overthrow it , and those communities (canada and england , for example) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same old regime . if the role of the militia were offensive , to go out and destroy repressive governments , nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate . but their jobs is defensive , and nuclear weapons aren't suited for that . there is also the question of personal and collective arms: the second amendment definately protects ownership of personal weapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members to provide their own arms .) but it isn't clear if it covers other arms . certainly , not all members would supply (for example) a tank , only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively) should . however , those providing the heavy weapons have a disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower . the militias , as the framers envisioned them , were extremely democratic: if only 50% of the members supported the cause , only 50% would respond to a muster , and the militia's firepower would be proportionately reduced . militia firepower and the popular will were , therefore , linked . but if a small minority of the members supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the form of heavy weapons) this would all change: the militia's firepower would depend on the will of a small minority , not of the general public . worse , that minority would be quite different from the general public (at the very least , they would be much richer .) as a result , i think the nature and character of the militia requires that each member provide a roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: his personal weapons , and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower .",2864

Nazis believed in racial purity, not racial assimilation.  An 
instructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies.  According to 
Nazi theoreticians, Gypsies were an Aryan race.  They were persecuted,
and in huge numbers murdered, because most European Gypies were
considered not pure Gypsies but ""mongrels"" formed from the pure Gypsy 
race and other undesirable races.  This was the key difference between

  There was at least one blast consistent with petroleum products that I
saw, however propane is interesting stuff.  It doesn't explode on contact with
air.  It is *possible* for a tank to rupture without exploding.  Far more
likely, however, is that the compound was equipped with NG outlets running to
the tank.  Damage from the CEV's could have ruptured the gas lines, allowing
the gas to spread, unnoticed in the CS fumes and general excitement (propane
typically has a distinctive odor added to it for just this reason -- to smell
leaks), until reaching a flame or spark, and then Whooosh!  Fire everywhere,
and maybe an explosion.  Use of NG is pretty common in Texas, especially
semi-rural areas.


  This is true, but so far the FBI/BATF track record on this incident is very
bad.

from the twin cities? In an earlier post, it was announced that Norm 
Green was given until midnight of the last home-game of the North Stars
to cleanup his belongings and turn in the keys to the arena. 
Did this happen? Was Norm run-out-of-town?

Rumor has it that while he was attempting to remove the score board, 
the score-board fell to the ice and flattened Mr. Greedy to a large
piece of green paper. Arena management had to use the Zamboni (which 
they confiscated from Norm's truck) to clean-up the useless remains.

Come on!  Most if not all Arabs are sympathetic to the Palestinian war 
against Israel.  That is why the ADL monitors Arab organizations.  That is
the same reason the US monitored communist organizations and Soviet nationals
only a few years ago.  


All of these groups have, in the past, associated with or been a part of anti-
Israel activity or propoganda.  The ADL is simply monitoring them so that if
anything comes up, they won't be caught by surprise.



No, that is why World Trade Center bombings don't happen in Israel (aside from
the fact that there is no world trade center) and why people like Zein Isa (

This is a phenomenon known around work as ready-fire-aim. I am astounded at
the number of times people post strong opinions about things they not only
don't understand but publicly admit to not understanding. In fact, there's a
plausible argument that saves are a more rational stat than wins.

For the record, there are two ways that a reliever can get a save:
He must finish the game and either
1. have entered the game with the tying run on base, at bat, or on deck.
2. have pitched at least three innings effectively.
A pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same game.


But this is an argument that *wins* is a dumb stat, not saves.


This again doesn't support your claim about saves at the beginning of your
post.

 Furthermore, use of less effective [but still potentially lethal] force

Or claims to have discovered so...  It would hardly be the first time
they raided someone based on incorrect evidence.


It was a ""no-knock"", according to the Associated Press report.
Here's something I found in my collection:

    Excerpts from an article in the Knoxville News-Sentinel Final
    Edition Monday, March 1, 1993 (the byline is associated press):

    WACO, Texas - Fierce gun battles erupted Sunday as more than 100
    law officers tried to arrest the leader of a heavily armed
    religious cult.  At least four federal agents and two cult members
    were reported killed.  [...]

    The gun battles began when federal agents hidden in livestock
    trailers stormed the sect's head-quarters Sunday morning,
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    witnesses said.  The agents had warrants to search for guns and
    explosives and to arrest Howell, said Les Stanford of the ATF in
    Washington.  [...]

    Witnesses said the law officers stormed the compound's main home,
    throwing concussion grenades and screaming ""Come out,"" while three
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    National Guard helicopters approached.  For a moment, there was no
    response.  Then the shooting began. 

I think ""storming the sect's head-quaters"" and ""throwing concussion
grenades"" qualifies as a no-knock (or perhaps an illegal assault).

                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Probably not.  But then again, neither are you.

                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
And just what is ""his background""?  What prior crimes had he been
CONVICTED of?

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Sorry, BATF are ""Federal TAX Enforcement officials"".  They're not
police, nor do they have police powers.

newsworthy value of those speeches.  Likewise to the sysadmin

	Remember me, Tom?  I hope you'll respond, and I seem to
be a Voice of Reason or some such (I've been recieving fan mail,
so naturally my ego is somehwat inflated of late), and hope to
make a few points here.


	And our argument is that you cannot remove them from the people
who need restricting and not remove them from the people who don't.  A
fairly simple problem, given our size and numbers.  Do you agree?  We
all believe criminals, particularly violent criminals, should not have
firearms.  The problem is making a law that does this without trodding
upon the rights of the vast majority.  Nobody here seems to be able to
do it, and I doubt anybody in Norway can either.  Thus, we are left with
a philosophical difference: does the safety of a few justify restricting
the many?  We say ""no,"" while others say ""yes.""


	Can you provide a method that cannot be abused?  I doubt it.


	Of course.  This is not in contention.  What is in contention
is how much one has to pay.


	It is this ""giving a little"" that makes Americans wary...
We have seen this argument before.  You might remember how a
Chamberlain ""gave a little"" to a particular fascist/short asshole,
and how such ""appeasement"" worked.  While it might work in some
instances, it doesn't work in others, and since we cannot predict
the future we must be cautious in using actions that have a
history of failure.


	Cars are not essential in Norway any more than they are in
the USA.  I'm willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be
willing to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price.  Thus,
cars are not essential for your transportation.  However, the
arguments presented show that, since cars are used to kill far more
people than guns in the USA, it makes much more sense to restrict
cars than it does guns.  How one defines ""essential"" often depends
upon what one is willing to go through for that service.  When we
look at the raw data, such comparisons are not individually weighed.


	This depends upon what the populace was willing to do.  As
Desert Storm proved, even an armed populace won't just revolt even
when given a chance.  Still, would Hitler have done all that he did
with an armed populace?  We have to wonder, as some of his first
acts were to confiscate firearms.  Other points in history show
that dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace.
Thus, we're left wondering if Hitler would have been overthrown
or if King George was just unlucky in keeping the USA as a colony.
One can argue both sides; one also has to live with each action.


	It is about #2, but so far all proposals to curtail #2 have
wound up enforcing #1 as well.  I only wish that ""or"" was so logical.


	That was, on my part, purely in jest.  I merely pointed out
how we were from similar backgrounds racially, but of wholly different
backgrounds politically.  I thought this would underscore my point on
how our cultures were so different despite similar heritage.


	BATF can *only* enforce gun/tobaccco/alcohol violations.  Child
abuse is a matter for the individual states and local authorities.


	That hierarchy is a paid-for feed at many sites.  Most people do
not get it for this reason, and I suspect money, not censorship, is the
main reason.  Do you get alt.sex* at your site?  I can't read it here

I know it doesn't make sense, but since when is 'Napoleon' about
sense, anyway? Further striking bigoted and racist attitude of 
certain Greeks still exists in our day. Most Greeks insist even 
today, that the 537 year-old capital of the Ottoman Empire should 
be called not by its rightful name of Istanbul, but by its half 
a millennium-old moniker 'Cons*(whatever).'

Everyone knows that New York City was once called 'New Amsterdam'
but Dutch people do not persist on calling it that today. The name 
of Stalingrad too is long gone, replaced by Volgagrad. China's
Peking traded its name for Beiging long ago. Ciudad Trujillo
of the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo. Zimbabve's
old colonial capital Salisburry became Harrare. These changes
have all been accepted officially by everyone in the world.

But, Greeks are still determined on calling the Turkish Istanbul 
by the name of 'Cons*.'

How can one explain this total intransigence? What makes Greeks
so different from other mortals? 18-year-old questionable
democracy? Why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact,
for instance, that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in
1453 AD, and that this predates the discovery of the New 
World, by 39 years. The declaration of U.S. independence
in 1776 will come 284 years later.

Shouldn't then, half a millennium be considered enough time for 
'Cons*' to be called a Turkish city? Where is the logic in the 
Greek reasoning, if there is any? How long can one sit on the 
laurels of an ancient civilization? Ancient Greece does not exist, 
any more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil 
of Anatolia.

These undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. It 
is the same mentality which allows them to rationalize
that Cyprus is a Greek Island. No history book shows
that it ever was. It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock,
stock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years.

In fact, prior to the Turks' acquisition of it, following
bloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD, the
island of Cyprus belonged, invariably, to several nations:

The Assyrians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Egyptians,
the Ottoman Turks, of course in that order, owned it as 
their territory. But, it has never been the possession
of the government of Greece - not even for one day -
in the history of the world. Moreover, Cyprus is
located 1500 miles from the Greek mainland, but only 
40 miles from Turkiye's southern coastline.

Saddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi
territory and the Greek Cypriot government and 
the terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus
also was once part of the Greek hegemony.

Those 'Arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination
should wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront 
reality. Again, wishful thinking is unproductive, only 
facts count.

As for Selanik,

  <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled
  particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially
  as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the
  total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks
  led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to
  the great port of Izmir.

  Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual
  murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek
  efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912
  and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,
  when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>

  <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow
  Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to
  practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923
  which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new
  Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a
  series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where
  most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This
  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting
  Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also
  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica
  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By
  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a
  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting
  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the
  occupation of Greece starting in 1941.

  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for
  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.
  Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received
  thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by
  the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in
  flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained
  independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the
  Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during
  and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements
  in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among
  its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim
  refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the
  Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly
  to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as
  800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and
  east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more
  came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-
  1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,
  with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the
  Empire.>>

Note that this ominous prospect is fueled by the fact that various SC
and Prime outlets are wholly or partly owned by local NHL owners.
When/If Cablevision VP Chuck Dolan's purchase of the Islanders goes
through, the Islanders will be back solidly in the SCNY fold (their
original owners were, and they've remained due to a lucrative TV
contract).  The Flyer Snyders own the Philadelphia SC as well as the
Prism pay channel.  There are six teams affiliated with regional SC's,
another half dozen affiliated with Prime outlets, and other locals
like HTS and NESN who have barter arrangements.  With all this
cross-ownership, I was surprised that ESPN got the deal this

But it is subject to all kinds of bias, and is almost completely useless
for first basemen.  From the raw stats, there is no way to tell which of
a first baseman's putouts were made on throws from other fielders, and
which were made on his own plays; likewise, you can't tell whether a
double play was 6-4-3 or 3-6-3.  Fielding Runs thus gives a first
baseman no credit for putouts or double plays, only for assists and
errors.  

It thus favors first basemen who play deep, reaching a lot of balls but
forcing the pitcher to cover first more frequently.  It also hurts first
baseman who play behind left-handed pitching staffs and thus face few
left-handed batters.


This is better; of course, it still isn't all of a first baseman's
defense.


Defensive Average, which uses larger (and probably better) zones, has
Mattingly tied for second in the league.


While 233 batting runs is good, it is mostly in the past; the runs he
produced in 1986 don't say much about his value in 1993.

[PTS]       --------------------------------------------------------
[PTS]                            By Alec Rasizade
[PTS] 
[PTS] 

[AR] Western readers have learned of the Nagorno (Upper) Karabakh
[AR] controversy through reports from that remote area by Western
[AR] correspondents and from commentaries by member of the long-established
[AR] Armenian-American community.  Azeri views on this dispute have
[AR] appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media.  Therefore let me
[AR] present _Washington Report_ readers with some basic truths about the
[AR] origins of the conflict.

During the past two years, if one reads all the commentaries on the subject,
a small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri.

The following should be interesting. 

[AR] Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and
[AR] expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic.  Actually,
[AR] the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian
[AR] Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988,
[AR] when 165,000 Azeris were driven out of Armenia.  Following that move,
[AR] there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait
[AR]in February 1988 and two years later, in Baku in January 1990.

This not true. Other than simply checking the newspapers, I will quote from an
independent human rights report. In the _PAX Cristi Netherlands_, 29 September
1991, page 28, we read:

 ""By mid-november, many incidents took place in several places in
  Azerbaijan. The APF [Azeri Popular Front] challenged the Communist Party
  for power. ... After ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to
  reimpose their power. In Nakhitchevan, the last Armenian villages were
  deported. In Ganja, Armenians were attacked and killed. All 40,000 
  Armenian inhabitants fled the city...""

  Between 22 November and 8 December 1988, refugees from Ganja arrived in
  Armenia while all 167,000 Azeris in Armenia were chased away.""

In this part of the world February 1988 [start of organized anti-Armenian 
pogroms in Azerbaijan] come before November and December of 1988!

[AR] Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that
[AR] both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule
[AR] in the Transcaucasus, according to the Roman principle of ""divide and
[AR] rule.""  Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year
[AR] history of the conflict.

It is interesting that the Azeris killed, burnt, raped the Armenians but the
perpetrators blame Russians, and Armenians themselves on other occasions.
 
[AR] Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in
[AR] Zheleznovodsk, Moscow, Tehran, Rome, Geneva and Alma-Ata), an
[AR] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed.  Those interested in
[AR] maintaining the Azeri-Armenian conflict, as well as the Georgian
[AR] turmoil, are imperialist forces in Russia, and probably in Iran.

Incorrect! When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in an
agreement? Never. Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno-
Karabakh there will never be an end to this conflict.
 
[AR] The Armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new Azeri
[AR] refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and
[AR] adjacent rural districts.  Today 500,000 Azeri refugees throng the
[AR] city of Baku and environs, providing more problems for the newly
[AR] elected Popular Front government, which is opposed by the rigidly
[AR] nationalistic National Independence Party.
 
It's called war. If the Azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the 
Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ways, keep their Armenian
culture, these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence. The
Azeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over and
play dead. 

[AR] How can a Western-style democracy survive in a small Muslim country
[AR] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed?  In the
[AR] absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees, as Kurdish
[AR] and Bosnian refugees have been helped, how can the Azeri government
[AR] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands, homes and
[AR] possessions?

The Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they
attempted to deprive Armenians of ""lands, homes, and possessions"".
 
[AR] Such simple realities must be understood in the West.
[AR] Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian
[AR] public opinion to imagine a permanent, and therefore irreversible,
[AR] ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus.

True, and you, Dr. Alec Rasizade, should practice what you preach!
 
[AR] I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea.
[AR] Meanwhile, continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western
[AR] states into the conflict through activation of various security
[AR] alliances.  These include, on the Armenian side, the Moscow-led
[AR] Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact, signed
[AR] May 15, 1992.  On the Azeri side, should Turkey get involved as the

Western interference! Turkish intervention! The moment Turkey dares step into
this conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of 
Europe (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia!
Dr. Rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would
have us believe.
 
[AR] Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an
[AR]""Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan.""  The truth is that the Armenians
[AR] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century.

Incorrect once again. A brief scan of history addresses such a foolish
claim. 

Armenians today, refer to the area of Nagorno-Karabakh as ""Artsakh"", which 
comes from the Urartian term ""Urtekhe-Urtekhini"". NO Azeris yet! 

Ancient Greeks referred to Artsakh as ""Orkhistena"". NO Azeris yet!

In the first half of the 6th century B.C., Artsakh, as part of Ervandid
Armenia of Media. NO Azeris yet!

From the end of the 4th century B.C., Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom
of Ervan. NO Azeris yet!

Artsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran. Orkhistena, or 
Artsakh is refereed to by Strabo, as part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!

After Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in 387 
A.D. until 428, Artsakh was part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!

End of the 5th century, Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the 
Aranshakhiks. NO Azeris yet!

By the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed. NO Azeris yet!

Emperor Konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen ""To
Armenia"". Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh. NO Azeris yet!

In the decree of Paul I (1797), the number of Armenian families in this area
was stated as 11,000.

It was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-Armenians from Central
Asia, Asia Minor, and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence
in the planes of Artsakh. Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh!

In 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia. Officiallt part of Russia 1828. Some 
Muslims in Karabakh!

In 1914, the number of Armenian churches in Nagorno-Karabagh was 224, 188
priests, 206,768 parishioners in 224 Armenian towns and villages. The Armenian
percentage of the population was over 90%. MAX: 10% Azeris in Karabakh --
assuming no Kurds!

Consider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December 1, 1920:

 ""The Worker-Peasant Government of Azerbaidzan, having been informed of the
  proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic, sends its greetings
  to the brother people. From this day the previous boundaries between
  Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled. Nagornyi Karabakh, Zangezur, and
  Nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the Armenian Socialis
  Republic.

  Long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of Soviet
  Armenia and Azerbaidzan!

				Chairman of the Revcom of Azerbaidzan
							N. Narimanov

				People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs
							Guseinov""

[AR] A few years ago they celebrated the 150th anniversary of their
[AR] resettlement from Persia to Karabakh, after it came under Russian
[AR] rule. 

No, incorrect. The 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of Russian rule
in the Caucasus, including Karabakh!

[AR] At the same time the Russian colonial administration also drew
[AR] in Russian and German settlers, who were welcomed by Azeris.  How
[AR] would Americans react if the large numbers of Armenians living in
[AR] southern California suddenly claimed an Armenian homeland, and
[AR] demanded separation from California?

Non-sequitur. 
 
[AR] Armenian historians insist that before the Armenian resettlement
[AR] Karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal Christians.  That is correct.

Armenian historians don't say this!

[AR] The people of medieval Caucasian Albania adopted Christianity in the
[AR] fourth century.  But those ancient residents had no link to and
[AR] nothing in common with Armenians.

Considering the Caucasian Albans were of the Armenian Apostolic faith, and
their utilization of the Armenian language in their liturgy, makes such an 
argument totally invalid!

[AR] Azeris would have a better claim to
[AR] be successors of Albania, since Azeris have for centuries inhabited,
[AR] dominated, and developed the Karabakh part of the Azeri nation.

Wishing to be part of a people non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo-
political advantage is rather outrageous. In addition to such absurdity,
Azeris claim to be Turks, Persians, and all the while are Azerizing their
minorities, such as the Lezgians, Kurds, Tat, Talish, and a host of other
nationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of Azerbaijan.

[AR] Both Armenia and Azerbaijan last year signed the Final Act of the
[AR] Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975, and the
[AR] Paris Charter for New Europe of 1990, confirming their mutual
[AR] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders.  This
[AR] principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the
[AR] Republic of Azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory
[AR] nations, not just by Turkey.

Such agreements do not give Azerbaijan the right to de-populate Karabakh of
Armenians.
 
[AR] This is one key to intervention on behalf either of the U.N., the
[AR] CSCE, the Commonwealth, NATO or Iran.  The second key to untying the
[AR] Caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor, according to the
[AR] U.N. definition of 1974.

Fine, so why has Azerbaijan refused to allow UN troops into the Armenian
enclave? What is Azerbaijan afraid of? Perhaps the fact that the territory
is the home of Armenians, the UN, would by definition, support the local
population! 
 
[AR] When that is accomplished, the international community can and should
[AR] apply to the aggressor in the Caucasus international sanctions such as
[AR] those presently being employed against Serbia and Montenegro in the
[AR] former Yugoslavia.  Such decisive collective international action can
[AR] halt further aggression in Karabakh, and prevent the Armenian-Azeri
[AR] conflict from growing and spreading.
 
Azerbaijan's refusal to allow the Armenians of Karabakh to determine their
own future the is issue, not viewing isolating events out of context are 
actions that will address the Karabakh conflict. Viewing events in a war
in isolation and out of context is like viewing the landing at Normandy as
an act of Allied aggression!

[ar] armenian leaders claim that azerbaijan was the first to oppress and [ar] expel the armenian minority from the azerbaijani republic . actually , [ar] the initiative to banish the azeri minority and convert the armenian [ar] republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988 , [ar] when 165 ,000 azeris were driven out of armenia . following that move , [ar] there were massacres of armenians in the azerbaijani cities of sumgait [ar]in february 1988 and two years later , in baku in january 1990 . this not true . other than simply checking the newspapers , i will quote from an independent human rights report . in the _pax cristi netherlands_ , 29 september 1991 , page 28 , we read: ""by mid-november , many incidents took place in several places in azerbaijan . the apf [azeri popular front] challenged the communist party for power . . . . after ten days , the authorities came in with tanks to reimpose their power . in nakhitchevan , the last armenian villages were deported . in ganja , armenians were attacked and killed . all 40 ,000 armenian inhabitants fled the city . . ."" between 22 november and 8 december 1988 , refugees from ganja arrived in armenia while all 167 ,000 azeris in armenia were chased away ."" in this part of the world february 1988 [start of organized anti-armenian pogroms in azerbaijan] come before november and december of 1988! [ar] azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that [ar] both events were inspired from moscow to secure russian imperial rule [ar] in the transcaucasus , according to the roman principle of ""divide and [ar] rule ."" similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year [ar] history of the conflict . it is interesting that the azeris killed , burnt , raped the armenians but the perpetrators blame russians , and armenians themselves on other occasions . [ar] each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in [ar] zheleznovodsk , moscow , tehran , rome , geneva and alma-ata) , an [ar] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed . those interested in [ar] maintaining the azeri-armenian conflict , as well as the georgian [ar] turmoil , are imperialist forces in russia , and probably in iran . incorrect! when were the people of nagorno-karabakh ever involved in an agreement ? never . until azerbaijan sits down with the armenians of nagorno- karabakh there will never be an end to this conflict . [ar] the armenian offensive last spring created more than 100 ,000 new azeri [ar] refugees from the captured towns of upper and lower karabakh and [ar] adjacent rural districts . today 500 ,000 azeri refugees throng the [ar] city of baku and environs , providing more problems for the newly [ar] elected popular front government , which is opposed by the rigidly [ar] nationalistic national independence party . it's called war . if the azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the armenians of nagorno-karabakh to live in their ways , keep their armenian culture , these armenians would not have had to defend their existence . the azeris should not have assumed that armenians were going to roll over and play dead . [ar] how can a western-style democracy survive in a small muslim country [ar] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed ? in the [ar] absence of any international effort to help azeri refugees , as kurdish [ar] and bosnian refugees have been helped , how can the azeri government [ar] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands , homes and [ar] possessions ? the azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they attempted to deprive armenians of ""lands , homes , and possessions"" . [ar] such simple realities must be understood in the west . [ar] misunderstanding caucasian politics leads both western and russian [ar] public opinion to imagine a permanent , and therefore irreversible , [ar] ethnic and religious rivalry in the caucasus . true , and you , dr . alec rasizade , should practice what you preach! [ar] i think western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea . [ar] meanwhile , continuation of the war could draw both eastern and western [ar] states into the conflict through activation of various security [ar] alliances . these include , on the armenian side , the moscow-led [ar] commonwealth forces under the tashkent mutual security pact , signed [ar] may 15 , 1992 . on the azeri side , should turkey get involved as the [ar] guarantor of the nakhichevan autonomy through the kars treaty of oct .

Yup, you said it.  I admire such honesty. ;-)


Fire an Anschutz .22, then come back and talk to us.  You're letting
ignorance and possibly fear cloud your thinking.  Either that, or this
is sour grapes because we beat you in the Olympic shooting events.
Funny, you'd think biathalon would be a natural sport for the norse. ;-)


Precisely.  That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry.
Not everybody has the time to train with a gladius, you know, but for
some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time.  To
extend this a bit further, you need only a certain level of competence
to beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with a
weapon and winning is much more difficult, and requires more training
time the average citizen just does not have.  I've spent a few years
practicing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one
(though self-defense isn't the reason I own one).  My kid sister would
have an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month of
training.  That makes firearms much better, in our eyes.


Excellent point.  Perhaps you aren't so naive after all?


Taken into consideration in what respect?  Though quite wrong, let's
make it a blanket statement for weapons in general.  This has been
taken into consideration.  We call use of them aggrivated assault,
assault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to kill, attempted
murder, and a whole host of others, and tack on extra prison time.


In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered
your land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and
shortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few
world wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons
tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.  I'm curious, though,
were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime, or
were they aquired by other means?  Any requirements other than just
registering the shotgun?


""Come on down to honest Erik's Used Swords!  Here's a slightly-used
short sword, *THE* battlefield supremacy weapon of the eleventh
century!  Only $39.95 with trade-in.  Easy financing!""  Sorry, I
couldn't resist.  You guys still slicing each other with long knives,
or is this really not a problem?


I'm all for that.  What gets me is that scandanavians (and yes, I'm only
a couple generations off the longship) used to be some of the most
feared warriors on the planet a mere millenia ago, yet now seem to
spend their time sitting in spas and doing a bit of topless sunbathing.
Maybe you had a bit more time, and a more homogeneous culture, to become
civilized with?


Yes.  We're too damned violent, partially I believe because we are not
a homogeneous culture and don't identify ourselves as ""Americans"" first
and foremost.  I'm rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage,
whereas I suspect you couldn't care less about that 2% Welsh blood in
your veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055?  The time scale
and the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a
basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good.
In America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal
liberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but
I trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict
individuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd
hazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and
personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would
have sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture
we have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy
to identify with only a small segment of the population.  My grandmother
tells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke
""low Dane,"" whereas others spoke ""high Dane.""  It was shortly after
World War II, as I remember, that ""low Dane"" was abolished so there was
one common dialect.  We cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem,
because we have even more obvious means of identifying an ""outsider.""

----------------------
There was a press conference by authorities at the compound on CNN earlier 
today (Wednesday).  It was explained that two news photographers were found 
on the compound earlier this morning without permission.  It was explained 
to the press corps. that this is dangerous and that an unknown photographer 
turning around with a long lens camera could be mistaken for someone dangerous 
by a Texas Ranger surveying the site. (!)  

The two photographers were said to be currently in jail and 
the press were warned to follow the authorities' guidelines.  
It was also emphasized that the survey of the ""crime"" scene at this 
point was crucial and that the press could not be allowed to interfere.
The press will not be allowed in until the bodies are removed and the 
site has been completely surveyed for evidence for a court case.  

That is the gist of the beginning of the conference to the best of my 
memory.  I bring this up because I haven't seen anyone else note it 
and I haven't seen the regular newscasts mention it.  It will 
probably be mentioned in the papers tomorrow.

My opinions:
-----------
I find this disturbing.  While I believe that Koresh is largely 
responsible for not ending this standoff in a peacable manner during the 
last 51 days of patient opportunity, I find the secrecy surrounding the 
aftermath more damaging to the authorities' position than they realize.

Since the vast majority of potential defendents in a court case are 
already dead, the emphasis on the importance of building the court 
case seems overblown to me.

my opinion is subject to change as more information is made available.

Please cite specific examples where an Arab party member was rejected
while a Jewish party member was accepted.  If you examine these I am
sure you will discover that the Arab party member did not have the power
base that his Jewish counterpart had.  The party structure in Israel
has changed quite a bit insofar as knesset member elections go.  Knesset
members for most parties are now elected via primaries.  The top standing
members end up with cabinet posts.  This is purely a political power
issue.  Check the ranking of Arab labor party members, as opposed
to Jewsih members and let me know which posts are held by Jews that
ranked lower in the party than their Arab fellow electees.

Once again, if for arguments sake, all the Arab Israelis were to vote
for Labor at the next election, you can rest assured that the number of
Arab MKs and cabinet members would increase proportionately to the

You are overlooking the fact that they wield political power

THE NEW VICE-PREMIER PLANS TO INTENSIFY THE WORK ON THE ATTRACTION OF
WESTERN INVESTMENTS

  BAKU (MAY 19) TURAN: Yesterday, Rasul Guliyev, the recently appointed
Vice-Premier of the republic, received the US ambassador in Azerbaijan,
Richard Miles. As ""Azerbaijan"" newspaper informs, the issue of attraction
of western investments in Azerbaijan was discussed in the meeting. In
particular, Gulyiev stated that western capital has to be investigated in
the most profitable spheres of manufacture. He also noticed, that the number
of the priority manufactures will be released from debts. 
Guliyev also said that intensifying the activities of the American oil 
companies will promote the strengthening of the American-Azeri relations.


THE PROPOSAL TO SUMMON SPECIAL SESSION OF THE SUPREME SOVIET IS REJECTED AGAIN

   Baku (May 19) Turan: Yesterday, in the sitting of the Milli Mejlis,
the chairman, Isa Gambar, rejected the proposal of the deputy Arif
Rahimzade to summon a special session of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan.
  This written proposal to summon a session was signed by 130 deputates. But
the chairman said that the signatures were invalid and the proposal couldn't
be submitted for discussion.
   Earlier, the leadership of the Milli Mejlis called the proposal to summon
a special session of the Supreme Soviet a coup attempt. But the deputy for
the Parliament, Rahimzade, doesn't consider that the deputates have the 
objective of removing Milli Mejlis and its chairman from the power. It concerns the
serious analysis of the social, economic and foreign policy activity of the
republic's authority. Rahimzade said that the deputates for the Parliament,
ejected from their duties one year ago have the rights to express their opinion
on these questions.
   The Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan (340 deputates) was dissolved one year ago,
when it attempted to bring Ayaz Mutalibov back to the power.
   The functions of S.S. were handed over to Milli Mejlis, consisting of 50
deputates (25 ""democrats"" and 25 ""partocrates""). At that time ""democrats"" and
""partocrates"" came to an agreement that Milli Mejlis wouldn't exist for a long 
time and would be dissolved after parliamentary elections. At the same time,
the deputates ejected from their duties were guaranteed that they could summon
a session of the Supreme Soviet any time and went in for political activity out
of the Parliament. --0--


THE PROSPECTS OF TRADE/ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN AZERBAIJAN AND ESTONIA

    Baku (May 19) Turan: The prospects of signing trade-economic agreement
between Azerbaijan and Estonia were discussed in the meeting of the Foreign 
Minister Tofig Gasimov with the group of experts of the Ministry of Economics,
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Estonian Bank administration on May 18. 
The group of experts is headed by Tikht Reiman, the chief of the Ministry of
Economics of Estonia.
   The MIA of Azerbaijan informed Turan agency, that in their stay in Baku,
the delegation will also visit Ministry of Economics and National Bank of the
republic.--0--


AZERBAIJAN DOES NOT INTEND TO JOIN THE CIS COMMON ECONOMIC ZONE

   Baku (May 19) Turan: Deputy prime-ministers of the republic, Vahid
Ahmedov and Abbas Abbasov declared that Azerbaijan wouldn't join the CIS
common economic zone.
   Vahid Ahmedov considers that the CIS economic zone proposal to create a 
common tax system contradicts independent economic policy of the republic. 
According to Abbas Abbasov, the pact of cooperation proposals, submitted for
the discussion of the leaders of CIS states in Moscow on May 14, has a number
of unfavorable points for Azerbaijan.
   Such announcements of two deputy prime-ministers sound sensational on the
background of the fact that the president of Azerbaijan and the chairman of
the Parliament noted the necessity of the republic on joining the CIS economic
zone.--0--


THE QUESTIONS OF GRANTING CREDIT TO AZERBAIJAN WILL BE DISCUSSED IN MOSCOW

     Baku (May 19) Turan: Today, Azerbaijani delegation headed by the director
of the foreign relation department of the Ministry of Finance of the republic
along with the representatives of the National Bank will leave for Moscow to
hold consultation with Russian government on granting credit to Azerbaijan. 
According to the preliminary information, the credit will be 50 billion rubles.
    As press-centre of Ministry of Finance informed Turan's correspondent, 
precise amount of the credit, conditions of its repay and a number of other
questions of mutual interest will be discussed in the course of the meeting in
Moscow. It is known that this credit will be mostly used for mutual settling
of industrial enterprises of Azerbaijan and Russia.
    When the sides reach the agreement, it is proposed for signing by the end 
of May.--0--


AZERBAIJAN WILL REPLY TO THE SECOND VARIANT OF TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BY 26 OF
MAY

     Baku (May 19) Turan: On the measures for peace presented by Russia,
Turkey and the USA to Azerbaijan and Armenia, the representative of the
president of Azerbaijan in the talks on Nagorno-Karabakh, Asim Gasimov noted
that the plan was not seriously changed in comparison with the first variant.
     ""Just some comments to several points were added to the schedule by 
insistence of the Armenian side. We do not intend to come back to the analysis
of the schedule, because we have given a positive answer to it on May 6"",- said
Gasimov.
     The representative of the president of Azerbaijan informed that they just
began to work on the examination of the commentary, and their answer would be 
given as requested by the authors of trilateral initiative by May 26.
     As it is known, the first variant of the peace measures was rejected by
Armenia, which put forward a number of pre-conditions for its acceptance.--0--


THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PROSECUTOR OF THE REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

   BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The Azerbaijani prosecutor's office has announced
that the Russian mass media's attempt to portray the 6 Russian soldiers 
condemned by the military board of the Azerbaijani Supreme Court, as innocent
people is unjustified.
    Accounts of the witnesses and the confessions of the condemned themselves,
prove that their crimes were committed together with the Armenian military units
and with the knowledge of the headquarters of the Russian army unit, where they
served.
    The announcement points out that the attempts to represent these soldiers
as ordinary mercenaries who have nothing to do with the Russian army are also 
unfounded. For there are irrefutable evidences that these soldiers were on the
list of one of the military unit's of Russian commandos in Yerevan.
   Certain Russian circles try to conceal the fact of direct participation of
the Russian army in the undeclared war of Armenia against Azerbaijan from the
Russian community. Azerbaijan's prosecutor's announcement follows, that this
type of actions can make the situation in the region much more complicated.--0--


AZERBAIJAN'S PARLIAMENT INTENDS TO APPEAL TO RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT REGARDING THE
SIX ACCUSED SOLDIERS

     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed, parliament of Azerbaijan
is considering the question of appealing to Russian parliament about the six
accused soldiers' fortune. In particular, the offer to send the representatives
of the Commission on military affairs of the armed forces of Russian Federation
to Baku for the detailed study of the results of six Russian soldiers' case will
be directed to Russian parliament.
     According to one of the supporters of this offer, such initiative will give
Russian parliament the possibility to be convinced of the correctness of the
investigation. There will also be a chance to discuss the reasons that have
given rise to the present situation - that is the Russian troops participation
in the war against Azerbaijan.


ARMENIANS ARE PREPARING MORE ""KARABAKHS"" ON THE NORTH CAUCASUS

     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The National-liberation front founded by group of 
Armenians living on the North Caucasus appealed to establish Armenian autonomies
on the territories of Rostov, Stavropol and Krasnodar regions, - reported the
newspaper ""Russky vestnik"" on March 9, 1993 published in Geneva.
     The North Caucasus is regarded as an integral part of Armenia in the 
documents of this organization. Admitting the non-realizability of ""reunion"" of
the North Caucasus and ""Armenia proper"" at present, the front is appealing to 
the UN, presidents of Russia, Armenia and the United States to consider the
need to establish Armenian autonomies on the Caucasus.
     To attain these goals, the Armenian organization considers it necessary to
carry out on the North Caucasus the forms and methods of activity ""identical to
those in Nagorno Karabakh"". Besides the decision to fund cells of Armenian
national-liberation fronts in every settlement and to appeal to leaders of
Armenian terrorist groups in Greece and Iran to sent to the North Caucasus 
instructors for training of Armenian youth to wage secret wars was adopted.
     Thus according to the newspaper ""Russky vestnik"", ""new Karabakhs"" are 
being planning on the North Caucasus. --O--


STATE ASSISTANCE FOR NATIONAL MINORITY DEVELOPMENT

     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The meeting headed by the State secretary of
Azerbaijan, Ali Kerimov, with the participation of the national cultural
centers was held in Baku. The first results of the realization of the president
Elchibey's decree on state assistance for the development of language and
culture of national minorities adopted on September 16, 1992 were considered. 
     The State secretary called this decree as an important step to establish a
legal democratic state. He confirmed once more the commitment of the leadership
of Azerbaijan to set up a democratic society in which the rights of all 
nationalities and ethnic groups would be respected.
     The State Counsellor of the president of Azerbaijan on the national policy,
Hidayat Orujev, announced that in spite of the difficulties of the ""undeclared
war"" against the republic, the leaders of the state managed to solve many 
problems concerning the satisfaction of cultural and other needs of the ethnic
groups. 
     For today, all 33 national-cultural centers registered by the Ministry of
Justice in the capital of Azerbaijan are provided with accommodation, furniture 
and means of communication. All the accommodations are rent-free ( 8 foreign
diplomatic missions in Baku are placed in the hotels because of the absence of
free accommodations including the representation of the UN General secretary). 
     As it was noted, a great work was carried out since the decree was adopted
to create conditions for total development of the ethnic groups. On the North of
Azerbaijan where Lezghins live, a national Lezghin theater was opened, 
radiocast is transmitted in Lezghin. The work over the creation of the
educational literature for Talyshs, Tats, Lezghins and Kurds and national
teaching and scientific staff is being carried out in the Academy of Sciences
of Azerbaijan.--O-- 


MEMORANDUM OF COOPERATION ON EXTRACTING OIL-GAS FIELDS OF AZERBAIJAN WAS SIGNED

     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed in the State 
concern ""Azerineft"", the Memorandum of understanding with the companies
""AMOCO Caspian Sea Petroleum"", ""Bi-Pi Exploration Operating"", ""Pennzoil
Caspian"", ""Unocal Khazar Ltd."", ""McDermott"" and Turkish oil corporation on
mutual extracting of fields ""Azeri"", ""Chirag"" and ""Gyuneshli"" was signed. 
According to the memorandum, the general group on preparing of a common
program of activity was created. 
     According to the president of ""Azerineft"", Sabit Bagirov, cooperation
will provide for using the experience of foreign companies more efficiently. 
     During the project, the main principles will be the effective use of
oil-gas resources, the rational sharing of investments, the reducing of
exploitation expenditures and maximizing the profit of Azerbaijan from the
exploitation of these fields. 
The memorandum also envisions the necessity to take into account the historical
and political-economical interests of Azerbaijan under optimum use of oil-gas
fields. --O--


ARMENIA TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PROSECUTION OF SIX RUSSIAN SOLDIERS

     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: After Azerbaijani court passed sentence on 
six Russian soldiers fighting on the Armenian side in Karabakh,
Armenian propaganda has become actively involved.
     The Armenians living in Russia appealed to the president Yeltsin
with a request ""to display firmness in asserting the rights of Russian
soldiers"". At the same time, Armenian mass media call legal proceedings
on the case in Baku as ""a farce aimed at getting more arms from Russia"".
     The Karabakh Armenians have issued a threat recently. If one could
believe the Yerevan agency ""Snark"", the Armenians in Karabakh presented
an ultimatum to authorities in Azerbaijan. The essence of this ultimatum
is that if Russian soldiers are not shown mercy, three Azeri prisoners in
Karabakh will be shot dead.
     It is simple to explain such ""touching attitude of Armenians"" to
the six Russian soldiers' fate. If by chance the sentence is executed
it will cause not anti-Azeri but anti-Armenian reaction, as the accused
Russian soldiers were recruited in Yerevan by the former Defence Minister
of Armenia and then transferred to Karabakh.
     If the soldiers get mercy, Armenian side will think highly of its
saving of lives of ""innocent Russians"". --O--


NEW PROVOCATIONS OF ARMED FORCES OF ARMENIA

     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: According to the Defence Ministry of
Azerbaijan on May 20-21, the firing on the territories of Azerbaijan
from the military bases on the territory of Armenia was in progress.
     The day before, the villages of Kolly-Gyshlag, Shotaraz,
Nyachaflar of Zangelan district of Azerbaijan were under fire from
Kafan district of Armenia. Two inhabitants were wounded, there were
destructions in the villages.
     On May 20, the firing on the villages of Bashkend, Mutudere,
Shynykh, Novosaratovka and Novoivanovka of Kedabek district of
Azerbaijan from the positions of Armenian armed forces was in
progress.
     At the same day the diversion group of the armed forces of
Armenia (50-60 men) violated the frontier of Azerbaijan, penetrated
into the territory of Kedabek district of Azerbaijan, killed two
shepherds at the village of Aili-Dara and made an attempt to take a
flock across the frontier. Azeri frontier-guards stopped the enemy.--O--


""UNOCAL"" COMPANY WILL BUILD 50 HOUSES FOR REFUGEES IN AZERBAIJAN

     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed by the
representation of UNOCAL American oil company, the leaders of this
company decided to give 750 thousand dollars for the construction of
50 houses for refugees.
     At present, the American side suggested a village project for 
consideration by appropriate departments of Azerbaijan. The project
is a farm village where each house has a personal lot, subsidiary
accommodations and so on.
     According to the program the construction and putting into
operation of the village will be this year. --O--


MANAT IS BEGINNING TO FALL IN VALUE

     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: Lately, at the black market of Baku, the
national currency - Manat, fell in price compared with the Russian
Ruble. Thus one gives 1100 Rubles or 120 Manats for one US dollar.
Taking into account the official exchange-value of the Manat with 
respect to Ruble which is 1-10, the national currency fell in value
10 percent. Meanwhile the exchange-value of the Manat to the Ruble is
the same at banks, state establishments and in trade.
     According to the representatives of the business circles and
experts, the present situation is explained by the fact that the rubles
are bought by the local businessmen. They need rubles for financial
operations in Russia. As the remittance of payments from the republics
of the former USSR to Russia is a great problem now, many businessmen
arrange deals in cash. Taking into consideration the volume of business 
with Russia, counted by billions, it is not hard to imagine how much

Soviet be established to clarify the circumstances of this criminal
case. In his view, ""the conclusion of the commission could help in the

WILL THE TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BE RUINED?

      Baku (May 22) Turan: As Turan agency was informed, Russian representative
to the talks on Karabakh, Vladimir Kazimirov, doubted in realization of the 
Trilateral initiative. He expressed this opinion during a telephone talk with
the representatives of Azerbaijan. At the same talk he declared, that in case
the peace process deadlocked, Russia would pursue Yeltsin's initiative itself.
     Such statement from the Russian diplomat, who is one of the authors
of the Trilateral initiative, suggests that the Russian leadership is
paving the way for complete exclusion of the USA and probably Turkey from
the peacemaking process. This statement can also mean, that Russia and
US having achieved understanding on Bosnian problem, have agreed on partial
US departure from Transcaucasia.--0--

on Geneshli and 150 mln.ton on Chirag.
   The exploitation of these fields is to last tens of years and it is to

economic profit, Baku calculates upon the political support of the West in

   As president Elchibey said in his closest encirclement ""the May of
1993 will be one of the most difficult periods for Azerbaijan and its
independence and we have to stand these tests"".--0--

informs, today, the appeal of the Institute of the Government and law of the

Russian servicemen being drawn in such grave crime.

deputates . but the chairman said that the signatures were invalid and the proposal couldn't be submitted for discussion . earlier , the leadership of the milli mejlis called the proposal to summon a special session of the supreme soviet a coup attempt . but the deputy for the parliament , rahimzade , doesn't consider that the deputates have the objective of removing milli mejlis and its chairman from the power . it concerns the serious analysis of the social , economic and foreign policy activity of the republic's authority . rahimzade said that the deputates for the parliament , ejected from their duties one year ago have the rights to express their opinion on these questions . the supreme soviet of azerbaijan (340 deputates) was dissolved one year ago , when it attempted to bring ayaz mutalibov back to the power . the functions of s .s . were handed over to milli mejlis , consisting of 50 deputates (25 ""democrats"" and 25 ""partocrates"") . at that time ""democrats"" and

azerbaijan does not intend to join the cis common economic zone baku (may 19) turan: deputy prime-ministers of the republic , vahid ahmedov and abbas abbasov declared that azerbaijan wouldn't join the cis common economic zone . vahid ahmedov considers that the cis economic zone proposal to create a common tax system contradicts independent economic policy of the republic . according to abbas abbasov , the pact of cooperation proposals , submitted for the discussion of the leaders of cis states in moscow on may 14 , has a number of unfavorable points for azerbaijan . such announcements of two deputy prime-ministers sound sensational on the background of the fact that the president of azerbaijan and the chairman of the parliament noted the necessity of the republic on joining the cis economic zone .--0-- the questions of granting credit to azerbaijan will be discussed in moscow baku (may 19) turan: today , azerbaijani delegation headed by the director of the foreign relation

acceptance .--0-- the announcement of the prosecutor of the republic of azerbaijan baku (may 20) turan: the azerbaijani prosecutor's office has announced that the russian mass media's attempt to portray the 6 russian soldiers condemned by the military board of the azerbaijani supreme court , as innocent people is unjustified . accounts of the witnesses and the confessions of the condemned themselves , prove that their crimes were committed together with the armenian military units and with the knowledge of the headquarters of the russian army unit , where they served . the announcement points out that the attempts to represent these soldiers as ordinary mercenaries who have nothing to do with the russian army are also unfounded . for there are irrefutable evidences that these soldiers were on the list of one of the military unit's of russian commandos in yerevan . certain russian circles try to conceal the fact of direct participation of the russian army in the undeclared war of armenia against azerbaijan from the russian community . azerbaijan's prosecutor's announcement follows , that this type of actions can make the situation in the region much more complicated .--0-- azerbaijan's parliament intends to appeal to russian parliament regarding the six accused soldiers baku (may 20) turan: as turan agency was informed , parliament of azerbaijan is considering

forces of russian federation to baku for the detailed study of the results of six russian soldiers' case will be directed to russian parliament . according to one of the supporters of this offer , such initiative will give russian parliament the possibility to be convinced of the correctness of the investigation . there will also be a chance to discuss the reasons that have given rise to the present situation - that is the russian troops participation in the war against azerbaijan . armenians are preparing more ""karabakhs"" on the north caucasus baku (may 20) turan: the national-liberation front founded by group of armenians living on the north caucasus appealed to establish armenian autonomies on the territories of rostov , stavropol and krasnodar regions , - reported the newspaper ""russky vestnik"" on march 9 , 1993 published in geneva . the north caucasus is regarded as an integral part of armenia in the documents of this organization . admitting the non-realizability of ""reunion"" of the north caucasus and ""armenia proper"" at present , the front is appealing to the un , presidents of russia , armenia and the united states to consider the need to establish armenian autonomies on the caucasus . to attain these goals , the armenian organization considers it necessary to carry out on the north caucasus the forms and methods of activity ""identical to those in nagorno karabakh"" . besides the decision to fund cells of armenian national-liberation fronts in every settlement and to appeal to leaders of armenian terrorist groups in greece and iran to sent to the north caucasus instructors for training of armenian youth to wage secret wars was adopted . thus according to the newspaper ""russky vestnik"" , ""new karabakhs"" are being planning on the north caucasus . --o-- state assistance for national minority development baku (may 20) turan: the meeting headed by the state secretary of azerbaijan , ali kerimov , with the participation of the national cultural centers was held in baku . the first results of the realization of the president elchibey's decree on state assistance for the development of language and culture of national minorities adopted on september 16 , 1992 were considered . the state secretary called this decree as an important step to establish a legal democratic state . he confirmed once more the commitment of the leadership of azerbaijan to set up a democratic society in which the rights of all nationalities and ethnic groups would be respected . the state counsellor of the president of azerbaijan on the national policy , hidayat orujev , announced that in spite of the difficulties of the ""undeclared war"" against the republic , the leaders of the state managed to solve many problems concerning the satisfaction of cultural and other needs of the ethnic groups . for today , all 33 national-cultural centers registered by the ministry of justice in the capital of azerbaijan are provided with accommodation , furniture and means of communication . all the accommodations are rent-free ( 8 foreign diplomatic missions in baku are placed in the hotels because of the absence of free accommodations including the representation of the un general secretary) . as it was noted , a great work was carried out since the decree was adopted to create conditions for total development of the ethnic groups . on the north of azerbaijan where lezghins live , a national lezghin theater was opened , radiocast is transmitted in lezghin . the work over the creation of the educational literature for talyshs , tats , lezghins and kurds and national teaching and scientific staff is being carried out in the academy of sciences of azerbaijan .--o-- memorandum of cooperation on extracting oil-gas fields of azerbaijan was signed baku (may 20) turan: as turan agency was informed in the state concern ""azerineft"" , the memorandum of understanding with the companies ""amoco caspian sea petroleum"" , ""bi-pi exploration operating"" , ""pennzoil caspian"" , ""unocal khazar ltd ."" , ""mcdermott"" and turkish oil corporation on mutual extracting of fields ""azeri"" ,

bagirov , cooperation will provide for using the experience of foreign companies more efficiently . during the project , the main principles will be the effective use of oil-gas resources , the rational sharing of investments , the reducing of exploitation expenditures and maximizing the profit of azerbaijan from the exploitation of these fields . the memorandum also envisions the necessity to take into account the historical and political-economical interests of azerbaijan under optimum use of oil-gas fields . --o-- armenia taking advantage of the prosecution of six russian soldiers baku (may 21) turan: after azerbaijani court passed sentence on six russian soldiers fighting on the armenian side in karabakh , armenian propaganda has become actively involved . the armenians living in russia appealed to the president yeltsin with a request ""to display firmness in asserting the rights of russian soldiers"" . at the same time , armenian mass media call legal proceedings on the case in baku as ""a farce aimed at getting more arms from russia"" . the karabakh armenians have issued a threat recently . if one could believe the yerevan agency ""snark"" , the armenians in karabakh presented an ultimatum to authorities in azerbaijan . the essence of this ultimatum is that if russian soldiers are not shown mercy , three azeri prisoners in karabakh will be shot dead . it is simple to explain such ""touching attitude of armenians"" to the six russian soldiers' fate . if by chance the sentence is executed it will cause not anti-azeri but anti-armenian reaction , as the accused russian soldiers were recruited in yerevan by the former defence minister of armenia and then transferred to karabakh . if the soldiers get mercy , armenian side will think highly of its saving of lives of ""innocent russians"" . --o-- new provocations of armed forces of armenia baku (may 21) turan: according to the defence ministry of azerbaijan on may 20-21 , the firing on the territories of azerbaijan from the military bases on the territory of armenia was in progress . the day before , the villages of kolly-gyshlag , shotaraz , nyachaflar of zangelan district of

suggested a village project for consideration by appropriate departments of azerbaijan . the project is a farm village where each house has a personal lot , subsidiary accommodations and so on . according to the program the construction and putting into operation of the village will be this year . --o-- manat is beginning to fall in value baku (may 21) turan: lately , at the black market of baku , the national currency - manat , fell in price compared with the russian ruble . thus one gives 1100 rubles or 120 manats for one us dollar . taking into account the official exchange-value of the manat with respect to ruble which is 1-10 , the national currency fell in value 10 percent . meanwhile the exchange-value of the manat to the ruble is the same at banks , state establishments and in trade . according to the representatives of the business circles and experts , the present situation is explained by the fact that the rubles are bought by the local businessmen . they need rubles for financial operations in russia . as the remittance of payments from the republics of the former ussr to russia is a great problem now , many businessmen arrange deals in cash . taking into consideration the volume of business with russia , counted by billions , it is not hard to imagine how much rubles in cash the businessmen need . --o-- the discussion of parliamentary election bill

I'm still catching up from Spring Break, but bear with me...



Javy Lopez has proven, over 1400+ AB in the minor leagues, that he is
ready to play in the majors. He is *not* being rushed. Players who are
clearly too good for AA and play behind stiffs at the major league level
are wasting their time, and may actually have a court case against
major league management for keeping them, at AAA.


Unless Lopez is *me* defensively (I'm 5'7'', 165 and born to play
second base :-)), he belongs in the major leagues.


Valentine isn't saying he should back up. He's saying he should be put
in a position to *win* the job in the major leagues, which, IMHO, he
would if given the opportunity. (Val, if I'm misinterpreting, please
let me know.)



But the players who *are* ready are 1)the best and 2) the ones most
likely to benefit from being in the majors. Javy Lopez is not a middle-
of-the-road prospect. He's the real thing. NOW. 

Again, the most important thing a player can do is hit. Lopez does that
miles better than Olson or Berryhill. If his defense is good enough for
Greenville, or Richmond, it's good enough for Atlanta. If he really was
awful defensively, he would no longer be a catcher. See Sprague, Ed.


Oh, where to start... OK. First of all, solid != good. I want good players.
Solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really
aren't very good at baseball. Think of it as ""TWG"" without the caps.
It's a losing strategy to say, ""We have solid guys, we don't need to improve.""
You used it four times in that paragraph, BTW.

Same for experienced. I might add, though, that Greg Olson and Damon
Berryhill aren't exactly Carter and Fisk. Olson has played three years,
Berryhill five, although 90 and 91 were a wash. The only difference,
IMHO, between Olson and Valle is the supporting cast.

""Two big bats."" Hrm. I like Justice, but I find Mr. Gant's trend disturbing.
Call it one and a maybe. The Braves' platoon is OK, but neither player
has *any* value outside of the platoon. Bream vs. LH and Hunter vs. RH
are awful. I'll leave the thirdbase comment alone. Pendleton has wasted
too much bandwidth already. If the CF platoon hits .300, I'll retrace
Mr. Likhani's midnight run down Forbes, and I live in NY and LA.
(Got that, Mike?)

And doesn't Cox call pitches, anyway?


Nope. They're baseball management, possible the most short-sighted 
collection of people in the nation. Do you not believe this goes on,
Mark? Do you think Frank Thomas needed those three months in AAA in
1990? Or Cal Eldred wasn't *really* better than Ricky Bones last year?

I am still awaiting for some sensible answer and comment.

It is a fact that the inhabitants of Gaza are not entitled to a normal
civlized life. They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967
without civil and political rights. 

It is a fact that Gazans live in their own country, Palestine. Gaza is
not a foriegn country. Nor is TelAviv, Jaffa, Askalon, BeerSheba foreign
country for Gazans. All these places are occupied as far as Palestinians
are concerned and as far as common sense has it. 

It is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizens
and the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionists
will begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the same
rights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. Not before.

Somebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israel
is entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case, Gaza should be
entitled to reciprocate, and deny Israeli civilians and military personnel
to enter the area. As the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a master
and slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading.

To close off 700,000 people in the Strip, deny them means of subsistence
and means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and a
crime. It is neither justifiable nor legal. It just reflects the abyss 
to which Israeli society has degraded. 

I would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain
why Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to return
and live there ? Would they be allowed to, if they converted to Judaism ?

Since your criminal grandparents ruthlessly exterminated more than
600,000 Kurds between 1914 and 1916 in Eastern Anatolia. Referring to 
notes from the personal diary of Russian General L. Odishe Liyetze on 
the Turkish front, he wrote,

""On the nights 11-12 March, 1918 alone Armenian butchers 
 bayoneted and axed to death 3000 Muslims in areas surrounding
 Erzincan. These barbars threw their victims into pits, most
 likely dug according to their sinister plans to extinguish 
 Muslims, in groups of 80. My adjutant counted and unearthed
 200 such pits. This is an act against our world of civilization.""

On March 12, 1918 Lieut-colonel Griyaznof wrote (from an official
Russian account of the Turkish genocide),

""Roads leading to villages were littered with bayoneted torsos,
 dismembered joints and carved out organs of Muslim peasants...
 alas! mainly of women and children.""

        (Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander
        of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War,
        Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov)

""The things I have heard and seen during the two months, until the
 liberation of Erzurum by the Turks, have surpassed all the
 allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of
 the Armenians. During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian
 was permitted to approach the city and its environs.

 While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained
 in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the
 area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to 
 attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the
 plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder
 of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by
 the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers
 who had remained in the rear during the war.

 One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of
 soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of
 seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,
 and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud
 and dirt...

 It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and
 traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds
 and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night
 patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The 
 Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear
 also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the
 trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for
 fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder
 and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.

 Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir
 Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander
 in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.
 The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals
 that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its
 highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half
 of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.

 ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,
 Odishelidge. They were as follows:

 The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the
 act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...
 More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been
 killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless 
 Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the
 murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood 
 near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:
 'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten
 more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when
 the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.

 The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently
 fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.
 Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw
 towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew
 to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and
 destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.

 During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages
 that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the 
 Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers
 were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time
 when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill
 the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries
 of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the 
 Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would
 have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from
 acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with
 hatred and loathing.

 Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that
 he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The
 Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the
 stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since
 the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed
 in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen
 of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping
 him with the iron heel of his boot.

 Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape
 from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off
 by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered
 children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village
 of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:

 There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.
 Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and
 spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about
 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 
 centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,
 children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of
 rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.

 A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators
 for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov
 to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be 
 proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's
 disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,
 instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely
 reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told
 the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more
 licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent
 and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity
 and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,
 the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and
 claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.

 An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command
 narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:

 The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut
 out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.
 The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men 
 of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they
 took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people
 among this group were able to save their lives as the result of
 my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were 
 released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. 
 Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the
 Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered
 on the streets.

 On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent
 Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were
 threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for
 murdering an innocent Turk. 

 When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would 
 be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare
 you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the 
 Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard
 that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within
 the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same 
 day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to
 him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible
 act. However no result was achieved.

 In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a
 natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived
 the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the 
 Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had
 been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. 
 The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed
 one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached
 three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details
 of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers
 were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even
 withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred
 people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading
 Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.
 However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with
 the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower
 classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders
 of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. 

 I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals
 were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who
 opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that
 it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.
 Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian
 cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have
 supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred
 to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by
 the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians.
 You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a
 conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear
 of the Turkish soldiers.

 The incidents that occurred only recently clearly manifest the real
 nature of the Armenian ideology. Nothing which is already done can
 be undone.""

(acting commander of erzurum and deveboynu regions and commander of the second erzurum artillery regiment prisoner of war , lieutenant colonel toverdodleyov) ""the things i have heard and seen during the two months , until the liberation of erzurum by the turks , have surpassed all the allegations concerning the vicious , degenerate characteristic of the armenians . during the russian occupation of erzurum , no armenian was permitted to approach the city and its environs . while the commander of the first army corps , general kaltiyin remained in power , troops including armenian enlisted men , were not sent to the area . when the security measures were lifted , the armenians began to attack erzurum and its surroundings . following the attacks came the plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder of the owners of these houses . . .plundering was widely committed by the soldiers . this plunder was mainly committed by armenian soldiers who had remained in the rear during the war . one day , while passing through the streets on horseback , a group of soldiers including an armenian soldier began to drag two old men of seventy years in a certain direction . the roads were covered with mud , and these people were dragging the two helpless turks through the mud and dirt . . . it was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and traps . the turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds and withdrew . the reason was that most of the turks who were on night patrol did not return , and no one knew what had happened to them . the turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear also . finally , the court martial which had been established for the trials of murderers and plunderers , began to liquidate itself for fear that they themselves would be punished . the incidents of murder and rape , which had decreased , began to occur more frequently . sometime in january and february , a leading turkish citizen haci bekir efendi from erzurum , was killed one night at his home . the commander in chief (odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days . the commander in chief has bitterly reminded the armenian intellectuals that disobedience among the armenian enlisted men had reached its highest point , that they had insulted and robbed the people and half of the turks sent outside the city had not returned . . . .we learnt the details this incident from the commander-in-chief , odishelidge . they were as follows: the killings were organized by the doctors and the employers , and the act of killing was committed solely by the armenian renegades . . . more than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless turks have been killed in erzincan . large holes were dug and the defenceless turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes . later , the murdered turks were thrown into the holes . the armenian who stood near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses: 'seventy dead bodies , well , this hole can take ten more .' thus ten more turks would be cut into pieces , thrown into the hole , and when the hole was full it would be covered over with soil . the armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently fill a house with eighty turks , and cut their heads off one by one . following the erzincan massacre , the armenians began to withdraw towards erzurum . . . the armenian renegades among those who withdrew to erzurum from erzincan raided the moslem villages on the road , and destroyed the entire population , together with the villages . during the transportation of the cannons , ammunition and the carriages that were outside the war area , certain people were hired among the kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages . while the travellers were passing through erzurum , the armenians took advantage of the time when the russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill the kurds they had hired . when the russian soldiers heard the cries of the dying kurds , they attempted to help them . however , the armenians threatened the russian soldiers by vowing that they would have the same fate if they intervened , and thus prevented them from acting . all these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with hatred and loathing . lieutenant medivani from the russian army described an incident that he witnessed in erzurum as follows: an armenian had shot a kurd . the kurd fell down but did not die . the armenian attempted to force the stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying kurd . however , since the kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony , the armenian failed in his attempt . having seen this , the armenian ripped open the abdomen of the kurd , disembowelled him , and finally killed him by stamping him with the iron heel of his boot . odishelidge himself told us that all the turks who could not escape from the village of ilica were killed . their heads had been cut off by axes . he also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered children . lieutenant colonel gryaznov , who passed through the village of ilica , three weeks after the massacre told us the following: there were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces , on the roads . every armenian who happened to pass through these roads , cursed and spat on the corpses . in the courtyard of a mosque which was about 25x30 meter square , dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 centimeters . among these corpses were men and women of every age , children and old people . the women's bodies had obvious marks of rape . the genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder . a few educated armenian girls , who worked as telephone operators for the armenian troops were called by lieutenant colonel gryaznov to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be proud of what the armenians had done . to the lieutenant colonel's disgusted amazement , the armenian girls started to laugh and giggle , instead of being horrified . the lieutenant colonel had severely reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour . when he told the girls that the armenians , including women , were generally more licentious than even the wildest animals , and that their indecent and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity and barbarity , before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers , the armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and claimed they had laughed because they were nervous . an armenian contractor at the alaca communication zone command narrated the following incident which took place on february 20: the armenians had nailed a turkish women to the wall . they had cut out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head . the great massacre in erzurum began on february 7 . . . the enlisted men of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people . then they took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts . 100 people among this group were able to save their lives as the result of my decisive attempts . the others , the armenians claimed , were released when they learnt that i understood what was going on . among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the armenian officers , karagodaviev . today , some turks were murdered on the streets . on february 12 , some armenians have shot more than ten innocent moslems . the russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were threatened with death . meanwhile i imprisoned an armenian for murdering an innocent turk . when an armenian officer told an armenian murderer that he would be hanged for his crime , the killer shouted furiously: 'how dare you hang an armenian for killing a turk ?' in erzurum , the armenians burned down the turkish market . on february 17 , i heard that the entire population of tepekoy village , situated within the artillery area , had been totally annihilated . on the same day when antranik entered erzurum , i reported the massacre to him , and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible act . however no result was achieved . in the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred , there was a natural silence . on the night of 26/27 february , the armenians deceived the russians , perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the turkish soldiers . later , it was understood that this massacre had been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular . the population had been herded in a certain place and then killed one by one . the number of murders committed on that night reached three thousand . it was the armenians who bragged to about the details of the massacre . the armenians fighting against the turkish soldiers were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even withstand the turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred people and two cannons , for one night , and ran away . the leading armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre . however , the armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with the renegades in this massacre , just as in all the others . the lower classes within the armenian community have always obeyed the orders of the leading armenian figures and commanders . i do not like to give the impression that all armenian intellectuals were accessories to these murders . no , for there were people who opposed the armenians for such actions , since they understood that it would yield no result . however , such people were only a minority . furthermore , such people were considered as traitors to the armenian cause . some have seemingly opposed the armenian murders but have supported the massacres secretly . some , on the other hand , preferred to remain silent . there were certain others , who , when accused by the russians of infamy , would say the following: 'you are russians . you can never understand the armenian cause .' the armenians had a conscience .

always be fooled by a curve ball low and away. If this is indeed a new

Dennis Martinez definitely did not have his good stuff. If he was grooving

Actually, this is incorrect.  French resistance may have played some
part in hindering the German war effort, however the crucial role was
supplied on D-Day.


Interesting statement.  Especially when you consider that Lebanon
had claimed to have made progress in the peace talks, as well as
Israel.  Of course, one of the prime obstacles to Israel's complete
withdrawal is the lack of governmental control that can be applied
to the area as well as the large presence of Syrian forces which
have not been asked to withdraw as well.

A-hem. Two words: Russell Davis. Playing in the cavern at Albany (AA) last
year (375/410/385 down the alleys and to center), Davis went .285/.355/.483
with 22 homers. There aren't any small parks on the road in the Eastern
League, either. He's 23(!) and his MLE was .258/.308/.416, 17 HR. I have no
fielding statistics, but from seeing him a number of times last year I'd say
that he's not Brooks Robinson, but neither is he Howard Johnson. Unless they
think they can win the pennant *this year* (which seems possible) and need
Boggs to do it, I think they're making the same sort of mistake with Davis
that Boston made with Boggs, leaving him in the minors for two or three
years after he'd shown that he was a good hitter.


Hrm? They still have him on the roster (16 AB through the first two weeks).
They've just never figured out what to do with him. I suspect that he hits
enough (especially vs. lefties) to be a reasonable shortstop. One rumor
running around during spring training was that they wanted to convert
Silvestri to be a catcher(!) because ""his body type was wrong for a
shortstop"".  You'd think that somebody in the same *division*, who plays
Baltimore about a dozen times a year, would know better.

He's been playing horrible defense. Baylor said after Wednesday's game that
he wanted to shake up the lineup a little, because Bichette has been
having a rough time defensively and Jerald Clark has not been hitting.
He was true to his word; I went to Thursday's game and Gerald Young
was in right and Daryl Boston (who has a very hot bat) was in left.
Baylor was careful to say though that he didn't necessarily mean for
these changes to be permanent but he wanted to give these other two
a shot while Clark and Bichette were not playing well.

In defense of Bichette, it looks like right field in Mile High Stadium
is a bitch to play. Some of the visiting outfielders have been having
some problems too (although Bobby Bonilla made a great catch crashing into
the wall to rob Daryl Boston of an extra base hit in Thursday's game)",0,rec.sport.baseball,"he's been playing horrible defense . baylor said after wednesday's game that he wanted to shake up the lineup a little , because bichette has been having a rough time defensively and jerald clark has not been hitting . he was true to his word; i went to thursday's game and gerald young was in right and daryl boston (who has a very hot bat) was in left . baylor was careful to say though that he didn't necessarily mean for these changes to be permanent but he wanted to give these other two a shot while clark and bichette were not playing well . in defense of bichette , it looks like right field in mile high stadium is a bitch to play . some of the visiting outfielders have been having some problems too (although bobby bonilla made a great catch crashing into the wall to rob daryl boston of an extra base hit in thursday's game)",836

1200,"Tim Belcher pitched a dandy three-hit shut-out tonight as Cincinnati won 
their second straight 5-0.  Pittsburgh Lefty Randy Tomlin was hit early and 
often by the heavily right-unbalanced Reds line-up, which managed some
recently rare power with their bats.

Belcher (1-1) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the
game progressed.  Early on he had several three-ball counts, but even those
were few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls while
striking out nine.  In a post game interview he said his change-up was working
for him--I should say so:  all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on 
breaking balls.

Tomlin (0-1), on the other hand was in trouble early, giving up a second-pitch
double to lead-off batter Bip Roberts.  Bobby Kelly followed with a single and 
Barry Larkin scored Roberts with a sharp single to right.  The big guys
(Mitchell, Sabo, Milligan) were unable to get anything after that--in fact
they all struck out--but Kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-steal
and a Tomlin wild pitch.

In fact, it appeared that Tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky
start-- he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only
2-0.  Randy Milligan, though, had different ideas as his line-shot was
poorly played by Orlando Merced and turned into a triple.  Milligan would 
later score on Reggie Sanders' sacrifice fly, giving Cinci the 3-0 lead 
after 4.

The fifth inning spelled loss for Tomlin when Roberts led off with his second
double of the game, and one batter later Larkin smacked a double down the 
left field line, chasing Tomlin.  Barry later would score the final run on
Tom Prince's two-base passed ball.  

The Pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the
fifth when Merced and Kevin Young hit back-to-back singles (the second 
being of the ""bunt"" variety), but Carlos Garcia struck out, Prince fit a 
foul fly, and pinch-hitter Lonnie Smith ""K'd"" to end any Pittsburgh hope.

Pittsburgh pitchers backed Tomlin up well, though:  relievers Blas Minor,
Moeller (sp?), and Nagel gave up only two hits in their four-plus innings
work.

Barry Larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he (mis)played 
bruised his right thumb.  He was taken to the hospital for ""precautionary
X-rays"".  Let's hope he's OK.

Cincinnati is now 4-9, still the worst record in the majors, but with the
two wins they may be looking at  moving out of the cellar!
Pittsburgh is now 7-6.

Well, maybe it will be.  Banks is a 24 year-old prospect who ""hasn't 
matured as quickly as they would have liked.  Mahomes is a 22 year-old 
who is very highly touted.  Tapani and Erickson are also young, and 
have looked very good this spring.  The last spot was between Jim 
Deshaies, formerly of Houston and S.D. and Mike Trombley.  Deshaies 
hasn't looked very good this spring, so I believe that the spot has 
gone to Trombley, although they hadn't wanted 3 starters this unproven. 
I personally believe very highly in Mahomes and Trombley.


Well, Scott Leius is the shortstop.  He played mostly 3B last year, but 
was a SS in the minors, and moved back after Gagne left to K.C.  3B is 
split (maybe) between Pagliarulo, who has had a great spring, and Terry 
Jorgenson, a good looking kid who has languished in Portland for 3 
years.  I'm not sure how the time will be divided, but they seem to be 
happy with what they have here.  I like Jorgenson, but I fear they

Though David Sternlight pushes the envelope of credibility by claiming that
talk.politics.guns is not the place to discuss guns, or the meaning of the
Second Amendment, it seems he would rather post to millions of people out 
of relative ignorance of the subject than to follow the currently active 
threads discussing EXACTLY this topic which at least explore the fallacies 
of his erroneous claim, and at most explode them.

Basic fact #1, Mr. Sternlight:  The RIGHT described is a ""right of the people
to keep and bear arms;"" not a ""right of the people to form a militia,"" a
""right of a militia to keep and bear arms,"" or a ""right of well-regulated
people to keep and bear arms.""  This should be apparent from a simple
reading of the sentence.

	I think that you are incorrect, Roger.  Patrick,
Smythe and Adams all played or coached in the league before becoming
front office types.  Hence, they did help build the league, although
they were not great players themselves.  

	I agree that a name is a name is a name, and if some people
have trouble with names that are not easily processed by the fans,
then changing them to names that are more easily processed seems like
a reasonable idea.  If we can get people in the (arena) door by being
uncomplicated, then let's do so.  Once we have them, they will realize
what a great game hockey is, and we can then teach them something
abotu the history of the game.  
 

	No, I would not want to see a Ballard division.  But to say
that these owners are assholes, hence all NHL management people are
assholes would be fallacious.  Conn Smythe, for example, was a classy
individual (from what I have heard). 

	Also, isn't the point of ""professional"" hockey to make money
for all those involved, which would include the players.  What I think
you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as
should have been their due, and it is the players that are what make
the game great not the people who put them on the ice, so naming
division after management people rather than players is adding insult
(in the form of lesser recognition) to injury (less money than was
deserved).

Although the Hebrew expression LE'UM is used, the ID card specifically states on
the 2nd page: EZRACHUT YISREALIT: Israeli citizen. This is true for all
Israeli citizens no matter what their ethnicity. In the United States most
official forms have RACE (Caucasian, Black, AmerIndian, etc.).


Funny, I have a number of maps and ALL of them have fixed borders.




Probably yes. So what ?





Apart from Mordechai Vanunu who had a trial behind closed doors, there was one
other espionage case (the nutty professor at the Nes Ziona Biological
Institute who was a K.G.B. mole) who was tried ""in camera"". I wouldn't exactly
call it a state secret. The trial was simply tried behind closed doors. I hate
to disappoint you but the United States has tried a number of espionage cases
in camera.



Not Jews. Israeli citizens. Jordanian law is in effect in the West Bank but the
KNESSET passed a law that Israeli law would be binding on Israeli citizens
residing in the West Bank. These citizens could be Jews, Israeli Muslims, Druze,
or Israeli Christians. It has NOTHING to do with religion.





Anyone who was registered (Jew, Muslim, Christian) could return. You might be
confusing this with the census taken in June 1967 on the West Bank after the
Six Day War. In *this* instance, if the Arab was not physically present he
couldn't reside on the West Bank (e.g. if he had been visting Jordan).



No. Not even if you drowned him in bourbon, scotch or brandy :-)




Not true. Although a minority, there *are* some Israeli Arabs living on
kibbutzim. On the other hand, at my age (42) I wouldn't be admitted to a
kibbutz nor could the family join me. Not that I would be so thrilled to do so
in the first place. The kibbbutz movement places candidates under rigorous
membership criteria. Many Israeli Jews are not admitted.



The religious status quo in Israel has marriage and divorce  handled by the
religious courts. The RABBANUT handles marriage and divorce for Jews, the
Muslim SHAARIA  courts are for Muslims, the Christian denominations have their
religious courts, and the Druze have their own courts. The entire religious
establishment (Jewish, Muslim, Druze, Christian) wants to keep it that way.


I believe it's adjacent to a former Muslim cemetary. From what I heard (and I'd
like to get feedback from Muslins  on the net) sanctity of cemetaries is not
held that sancrosanct as it is held by Jews. The current Israeli Ministry of
Trade and Industry on Agron Road in Jerusalem is housed in a former hotel that
was built by Arabs in the 1920's on the site of an Arab cemetary.

     stand, stand.  look, look, look.  ho, hum.  then, the bullpens
     come running in.  when they reach the ""fight"", they just stand
     there, too.

     anybody coming off the bench who does not throw at least one punch
     should be suspended and fined.  further, the bullpens should fight
     it out in the outfield, so as not to waste time and energy running
     to the infield.

	Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)

On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue
line and Nylander stripped him and took off.

The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.

The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it
ended up behind the goalie.

On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.
This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if
they get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,
Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of
them was the closest FLYER to the play.

That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it
was that scored, much less how.

From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart
asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the
game. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised
that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy 
Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season
and, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.
But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for
number 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between
him and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????

What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...

#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.
The difference between the team's record with him and without him is no
accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without
Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric
Lindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey
next season.

#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,
and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't
play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family
has a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy
Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again
about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.

#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season
scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player
get as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.
Not a tough choice.

Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total
which he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line
this year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the
defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.

Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie
mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling
that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up
anything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman
in years to come.

Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some
things you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,
he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his
wishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive
contribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end
will make him a much more important part of the team next year.

Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.
But consistency became a problem for him.

The FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning
percentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in
Patrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in
next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as
many goals as they allowed, 319.

The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.

I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey
News that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have
no other way of getting them.

I hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have. Knowing
the future that we have coming to us made missing the playoffs one more time
almost bearable.

He's a Canadian ""thing"". Former coach of the Boston Bruins and Colorado
Rockies. From the summaries that get posted I gather that his ongoing beef
this year has been the conventional wisdom that Canadian hockey is doomed
to be second or third rate behind the perceived emergence of the U.S.
and European programs.


After he left the Rockies, he got a job with CBC's Hockey Night in Canada
and hasn't looked back since. Actually, he did work for CBC at least
on playoff season after the Rockies were eliminated.


I'd say it's a combination of flame bait and serious journalism. The closest
thing you'll find to Cherry in the U.S. is Stan Fischler, a self-described
hockey maven. The similarities are that they both say things that get
people upset. The difference is that Cherry knows the game and Fischler
doesn't.


Don's a character. If he were completely rational and noncontroversial
he wouldn't have a job. By some definitions, he could be called an ass.
But then some people feel the same about Mike Lang, another character that
I wish would get wider exposure (only one national telecast last year).",1,rec.sport.hockey,"he's a canadian ""thing"" . former coach of the boston bruins and colorado rockies . from the summaries that get posted i gather that his ongoing beef this year has been the conventional wisdom that canadian hockey is doomed to be second or third rate behind the perceived emergence of the u .s . and european programs . after he left the rockies , he got a job with cbc's hockey night in canada and hasn't looked back since . actually , he did work for cbc at least on playoff season after the rockies were eliminated . i'd say it's a combination of flame bait and serious journalism . the closest thing you'll find to cherry in the u .s . is stan fischler , a self-described hockey maven . the similarities are that they both say things that get people upset . the difference is that cherry knows the game and fischler doesn't . don's a character . if he were completely rational and noncontroversial he wouldn't have a job . by some definitions , he could be called an ass . but then some people feel the same about mike lang , another character that i wish would get wider exposure (only one national telecast last year) .",1124

""The atrocities and massacres which have been committed for a long time
 against the Muslim population within the Armenian Republic have been 
 confirmed with very accurate information, and the observations made by
 Rawlinson, the British representative in Erzurum, have confirmed that
 these atrocities are being committed by the Armenians. The United States
 delegation of General Harbord has seen the thousands of refugees who came 
 to take refuge with Kazim Karabekir's soldiers, hungry and miserable, 
 their children and wives, their properties destroyed, and the delegation
 was a witness to the cruelties. Many Muslim villages have been destroyed
 by the soldiers of Armenian troops armed with cannons and machine guns
 before the eyes of Karabekir's troops and the people. When it was hoped
 that this operation would end, unfortunately since the beginning of 
 February the cruelties inflicted on the Muslim population of the region
 of Shuraghel, Akpazar, Zarshad, and Childir have increased. According
 to documented information, 28 Muslim villages have been destroyed in the
 aforementioned region, more than 2,000 people have been slaughtered,
 many possessions and livestock have been seized, young Muslim women
 have been taken to Kars and Gumru, thousands of women and children who
 were able to flee their villages were beaten, raped and massacred in the
 mountains, and this aggression against the properties, lives, chastity 
 and honour of the Muslims continued. It was the responsibility of the
 Armenian Government that the cruelties and massacres be stopped in order 
 to alleviate the tensions of Muslim public opinion due to the atrocities 
 committed by the Armenians, that the possessions taken from the Muslims
 be returned and that indemnities be paid, that the properties, lives,

Look how long the Maple Leafs and Nordiques used similar logic....  Not that
they fielded bad teams solely to field bad teams, but the Maple Leafs (and a
certain dead man who was in charge) were one of the cheapest teams in the
history of the sport.  Guess what-- they were immensely popular at the
gate.  The Nordiques have also done well for a team that had missed the
playoffs so many years in a row.


Ha!  Such humor!  They have MAJOR fan problems, namely that on occasion some of
them don't make it home from the match!  The soccer fans tend to be fanatical,

As of yesterday's paper, Huizenga's new hockey team will take the ice at

the arena, with four one-year options that could run through 1999.

""It's not our choice"", James Blosser, a lawyer and Huizenga Aid said

One reason is because the Miami Heat basketball team controls skybox

potential.

The hockey team is attracting arena site proposals from Broward, Dade, 
and Palm Beach counties.

A leading site is vacant land near Joe Robbie Stadium, where residents

There certainly are muslims who *do not* believe that their dream of 
a global Islamic community should be achieved through force. There are, 
however, others (and, they are often far more visible/vocal than the 
former) who *do* accept the establishment of global Islam through force. 
I  would *not* feel threatened by those only accepting or pursuing 
""Islamicization"" through peaceful means, nor by Jews advocating the same
approach. Those advocating force as a means of expanding their side's
power are certainly a threat.

To Palestinians, Israel is doing just that; maintaining its dominance
of those *outside* its own ""group"". If I am told that ""I am not one of
you"" but you then impose your control on me, damn right you are a threat.
If I am a member of a non-muslim minority *inside* the Islamic
world and *actively did not* accept my ""minority"" status, I *would also

through the powerful coercive force all majorities wield over minorities

This is the situation that brought the question up:

had the bases loaded with 1 out.  The batter hits a fly to center, which the
fielder catches.  The runner at third tags and scores without a throw.

you're down by 4?  If the tying run is going to score, so is the guy on third.)

Please, read my post carefully, I am saying that lift the arms emargo
and let the MUSLIMS defend themselves. The point is these Europians 
""civilized countries"" neither want to get intervene militarily themselves
and nor they like to see the muslims of the world to help the oppressed.
(Remember what happened almost one year ago when the so called UN discovered
some riffles in an Iranian jet in Bosnia!). The west is not indifferent
in this matter they are siding with Serbs by keeping this embargo on only
muslim side (okay on-paper on both sides).

Unfortunately, that is the way the league is heading... You can't fight,
so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when
the ref isn't looking. Ulf has brought this to a high level... Players
stuck in the past (like Neely) who prefer fights to cheap shots
are at a disadvantage in the new system.

Lets face it, A cheap shot (like high sticking) is a very effective
method... It is easier to hide from the refs, has a better chance of
causing injury, and you can draw people into fights that way. I don't
like it, but that's the way the league is going.",1,rec.sport.hockey,"unfortunately , that is the way the league is heading . . . you can't fight , so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when the ref isn't looking . ulf has brought this to a high level . . . players stuck in the past (like neely) who prefer fights to cheap shots are at a disadvantage in the new system . lets face it , a cheap shot (like high sticking) is a very effective method . . . it is easier to hide from the refs , has a better chance of causing injury , and you can draw people into fights that way . i don't like it , but that's the way the league is going .",594

Celebrating in joy the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Muslim 
people by your criminal grandparents between 1914 and 1920? Did you 
think that you could cover up the genocide perpetrated by your fascist
grandparents against my grandparents in 1914? You've never heard of 
'April 23rd'? 


 ""In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul.
  It is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us
  create for ourselves. It certainly is possible to severe the artificial
  life-support system of an imagined 'ethnic purity' that some of us
  falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats 
  in this alien land.""
            (Sahak Melkonian - 1920 - ""Preserving the Armenian purity"") 


During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, 
the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic 
genocide, tried to complete its centuries-old policy of 
annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 
2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year 
homeland.

The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance
of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.
This event is incontrovertibly proven by historians, government
and international political leaders, such as U.S. Ambassador Mark 
Bristol, William Langer, Ambassador Layard, James Barton, Stanford

  What the hell are U talking about? ESPN showed Pens/Devils game as advertised.
  BUt the morons at ESPN should know that Pens will kick Devils ass and the
  game will be boring. I'd rather see Boston/Buffalo game which seems to be
  an exciting series since noone had expected Buffalo to get past the first
  round. 

  Well let's hope they change their mind on THU's game and show some other
  game. The Pens series is really getting boring. I want to see some 
  exciting game no matter who wins. If NHL wants a major network contract
  then they better put some brains in ESPN people.

BET but someone forgot to throw the switch at 6PM) didn't know what I

While it's nice that the NHL is back on American network TV, it faces
the same problems as it did with the All Star game.  Local preemptions
and zero promotion (okay, I don't watch that much TV so I'm just foaming
all right?).  The league should have made sure that it was solid on cable
before going to the networks.  In year one of the new ESPN contract, the
saturation coverage of SCA (all other games shown to completion, like
the Quebec-Montreal and Sabres-Bruins overtimes) is missed around here.

3515,"Hi. I've just finished reading S414, and have several questions about
the Brady bills (S414 and HR1025).

1. _Are_ these the current versions of the Brady bill?
     What is the status of these bills?  I've heard they're ""in committee"".
     How close is that to being made law?

2. S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar.  Are there any important
   differences I missed?

3. S414 seems to have some serious loopholes:
  A. S414 doesn't specify an ""appeals"" process to wrongful denial during
     the waiting period, other than a civil lawsuit(?)  (S414 has an appeals
     process once the required instant background check system is established,
     but not before).
  B. the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying/approving
     using existing records (so who would I sue in ""A"" above to have an
     inaccurate record corrected?)
  C. S414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a person
     can convince the local Chief Law-Enforcement Officer (CLEO) of an
     immediate threat to his or her life, or life of a household member.
     But S414 doesn't say exactly what is considered a ""threat"", nor does
     it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception
     statement.
True?  Have I misunderstood?  Any other 'holes?

4. With just S414, what's to stop a person with a ""clean"" record from
   buying guns, grinding off the serial numbers, and selling them to crooks?
   At minimum, what additional laws are needed to prevent this?

   'Seems at min. a ""gun counting"" scheme would be needed
   (e.g., ""John Doe owns N guns"").  So, if S414 passes, I wouldn't be surprised
   to see legislation for stricter, harder-to-forge I.D.'s plus national gun
   registration, justified by a need to make the Brady bill work.

Ah, but the illusion in football is that there is always lots of action and
a sense of urgency because of the game clock (not all the time, but it happens
when there's less than 5 minutes to go quite often).  This sense creates
drama, even when there may not necessarily be any and that holds a viewer's
attention.  In baseball, only 3 players are involved in the action for about
(here comes a wild guess) 70% of the time?  And they're just playing a
sophisticated game of catch/hold-the-ball/step-out-of-the-box/adjust-chains/
touch-self-in-interesting-locations.  There's a lot of ""dead time"" with the
players warming up between innings or the manager visiting the pitcher at the
mound or the manager removing the pitcher and bringing in a relief pitcher
who then takes (8? 10?) pitches or Helen Dell playing the organ (Dodger fans
will appreciate that one).  To the non baseball junkie this is boring.
At any rate, I'm not putting baseball down for this - I've been an avid
fan since I can remember - it's just that watching a baseball game on
T.V. at home can be tedious for the non baseball junkie.  That's what Major
League Baseball and the networks are trying to address when they talk of
shortening the game.  It's because of T.V. not because ""football has more
action than baseball"".

According to the recent TSN report Peter Puck is not paying any interest
on the Treasury Branch loans.  That's a lot of green.


Again, according to TSN, virtually everything that Peter Puck has already 
has liens against it.  Of course we can't really be sure of this. 


The Oiler rationale regarding the renegotiation of player contracts is
that a deal is a deal.  Sather has spouted this repeatedly.  Pocklinton
has a contract with Northlands until 1999.  A deal is a deal.  Perhaps
if he included the income he has received from his sale of assets (players
such as Gretzky) and the income he has received in expansion fees with
his revenues he wouldn't be losing money.  He has admitted pulling this
money out of the Oiler franchise to put into his other businesses. 


I think that Pocklington has received ample provincial subsidization.  
I can't really blame him for going after municipal subsidization but 
he is certainly not entitled to it.  Pocklington has ""sucked"" revenue
out of the Oilers in order to prop up his failing business interests.
Pocklington is not to be trusted.  I doubt very much that any Oiler
team will ever again make the playoffs under Pocklington's stewardship.
As soon as a player shows himself to be a competent NHL'er and expects
to be paid accordingly he is shipped off for younger players and or
draft picks.

I tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues.
The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they
had little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example,
was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign.
His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie
year.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so
and then rebound.

Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had
good numbers immediately.

I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and
Derek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up
that they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but it
didn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.  I seem to recall CM pitching
well initially, though I don't have stats handy.",0,rec.sport.baseball,"i tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues . the braves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis , as they had little talent on their roster for some time . steve avery , for example , was rushed to the majors , and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign . his subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ era during his rookie year . bill james pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound . bob horner was also rushed to the majors (out of arizona state directly) had good numbers immediately . i am not certain of the ages of people like pete smith , craig mcmurty , and derek lilliquist . the braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed . lilliquist and smith struggled , but it didn't hurt ps and dl may have been overhyped . i seem to recall cm pitching well initially , though i don't have stats handy .",947

In today's Jerusalem Post Magazine there is a feature story about the
ongoing restoration of synagogues in the Jewish Quarter.  The author,
Leah Abramowitz, writes that there were FIFTY-SEVEN synagogues in the
quarter in 1948, ALL of which were destroyed, some, she says, used as
donkey stables.  The building shells, that is.

I still find it really, really hard to understand why the demolition
of the buildings in front of the Kotel continues to evoke more outrage
than this.  Everything is so much cheaper when it happens to the Jews.

How about Kevin Hatcher? Scored roughly 35 goals, plays 30 minutes a game.


That's really sad when two second-rate goalies (Barasso and Belfour)
are the main contenders for the Vezina. Call me crazy, but how about
Tommy Soderstrom - five shutouts for a 6th place team that doesn't
really play defense. It's really unfortunate that the better goalies
in the league (McLean, Essensa, Vernon) had unspectacular years. BTW,
if you are going to award the Norris on the basis of the last 30 days,
why not give the Vezina to Moog? He has been the best goalie over the
past month.

Hesketh only pitched one inning yesterday afternoon, his first outing

This is misleading.  I supposed Charles D. Smith characterizes the bombing
of the King David Hotel as a civilian installation too.  Any installation 
attacked by Etzel was linked to some sort of official function of the 
Mandatory government.


What kind of CIVILIANS?  I assume Charles D. Smith means completely innocent
people who were intentionally targeted, right?  Please provide examples.


Nice strawman.  In _The Revolt_ Begin does state that the *myth* of a massacre
at Deir Yassin may have had the effect of scaring some Arabs into fleeing.
However, nowhere does he claim that this was the result of any specific policy
of the Etzel.  Thus, if it did happen, it was not so intended.  I think Arab 
calls for Palestinians to leave and fear of a war started by Arab hands had 
a greater effecton Arab migration than Deir Yassin.

In fact these jewish TERRORIST groups managed

Really.  Nice use of caps.  I like it.  Very effective.  Actually, according to

Question #1

According to the NRA/ILA state firearms lawbook, in Wisconsin it is
'unlawful for any person except a peace officer to go armed* with a 
""concealed and dangerous weapon.""  There is no statutory provision for
obtaining a lixense or permit to carry a concealed weapon.'

*  Jury instructions indicate that 'to go armed' one must have a firearm

Does this mean that open carry is allowed?  If so, just how 'open' does it
have to be?  Would an in the pants holster be considered concealing?  What
if one had their jacket on and it partially covered the weapon?  Also,
is there any way to be allowed to carry concealed, or is it just not allowed,
period? 

Question #2

As I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns.
Is there any way to get around this provision?  What would the penalty if
you were found out be?  What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting
in your apartment there?  How would the city law apply to your impending 
trial for the shooting?
Also, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled
shotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, 
either that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).  
One more thing, what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being
rich or famous or related to the mayor?",2,talk.politics.guns,"a couple of questions for you firearms law experts out there: question #1 according to the nra/ila state firearms lawbook , in wisconsin it is 'unlawful for any person except a peace officer to go armed* with a ""concealed and dangerous weapon ."" there is no statutory provision for obtaining a lixense or permit to carry a concealed weapon .' * jury instructions indicate that 'to go armed' one must have a firearm on one's person or within his immediate control and available for use . does this mean that open carry is allowed ? if so , just how 'open' does it have to be ? would an in the pants holster be considered concealing ? what if one had their jacket on and it partially covered the weapon ? also , is there any way to be allowed to carry concealed , or is it just not allowed , period ? question #2 as i understand it , in evanston , il , they have a ordinance banning handguns . is there any way to get around this provision ? what would the penalty if you were found out be ? what if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting in your apartment there ? how would the city law apply to your impending trial for the shooting ? also , what is il state law concerning short barreled weapons ? short barreled shotgun is what i would be interested in if a handgun were not available , either that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie colt , marlin) . one more thing , what is the chance of getting a ccw permit in il without being rich or famous or related to the mayor ?",1476
3168,"Having read the posted long article by JPFO, I have some observations:

1.  This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a ""verbatim 
translation"" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place --
the book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section
by section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating.
In the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce 
the German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not 
surprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a 
single idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi
law; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into, 
urban-folklore style.

2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a 
copy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution 
team or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don't 
understand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable 
to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and 
yet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:

""If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons
Law during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of
documents, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German
law registry].""

Bingo.  Exactly.  

Dodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one
under discussion.  All of the stuff about ""Why would a U.S. congressman
have a copy of a Nazi law?"" melts away, by the author's admission.  He
then continues:  ""But if he acquired the original German text of the 
Nazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so 
for a very specific reason...""  But there's absolutely no reason to 
think that this is the case.  In fact, as a ""senior member of the U.S. 
team that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals"", it seems to me that
he would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether 
the Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously
is, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally
prosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red 
herrings.

3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the
JPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he 
asked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge 
levelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask 
to have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*.  If Dodd 
took it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing 
it into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*, 
wouldn't he?
    Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier
posting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this
purpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent
on disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil
liberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn't they have any idea how to do it
on their own?
    Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his
own question: ""Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law
to show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the 
Nazi law.""  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered
into the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents ""concerning
the history of Nazism and gun confiscation"", Dodd's motivation isn't a 
mystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.

4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that
was added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.  
Registration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT
a ""Nazi-inspired"" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the 
1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification 
of certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list 
other parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews;
of course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless,
in a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the 
discussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues,

Yes it is, as has been evidenced by the previous two stages
of withdrawal from the area and by the reductions in troops.
Currently the troops are kept at a level consistent with light
and armored patrols.  No permanent installations have been
built in the area, nor are any planned.

As to the prodigal ""water question"",  you can continue to waste
your time looking for non-existent proof, or you can accept the
testimony of people here, some Lebanese, who have acknowledged
that they know of no evidence for these allegations.


It depends which of those territories you refer to.
In general, settlers were moved into the territories because
at the time, in the context of the situations, it seemed the
logical move.  This is not to say that views don't change
or that mistakes are not made.  Currently, I would say that
the only ""disputed territory"" that does not appear to be temporary
is that of Eastern and northern Jerusalem.

Are you sure about this? I'm currently looking at a copy of last

a part in the middle which rather prominently says ""WANTED: We pay
cash for assault rifles and pistols."". Granted, I haven't seen today's
paper yet. But I'd be surprised if there wasn't a Traders ad in it.
It's probably worth it to write to the Chronicle (and other papers)

    ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES.

    The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former
Soviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of
hundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh.
    Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more
than 450  Azeris, many of  them women and  children, who were  fleeing an
attack  on their  town. Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  and
feared dead.
    The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending
the women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified
refugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:"" That's when
the real  slaughter began,"" said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to
survive. ""The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and
started carving up people with their bayonets and knives.""
    "" They were shooting, shooting, shooting"", echoed Rasia Aslanova, who
arrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through
Armenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed
in front of her. Her daughter was still missing.
    One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.

    The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately,
were still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their
wounds or the cold.
    By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in
Agdam's morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of the
seven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial, two  were children and  three were
women, one shot through the chest at point blank range.
    Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said they
had 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep
stab wounds.
    Nor were they safe in Agdam. On friday night rockets fell on the city
which  has a  population  of 150,000,  destroying  several buildings  and
killing one person.

Now wait, there is more.

           IT'S INHUMANE TO IGNORE THIS VIOLENCE

The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre:

69 year old Hatin Nine telling:

-''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told
me: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''

72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu:

- ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.
  Turks, you must die.''

28 year old Gulsum Huseyin:

- ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of
    my eyes.''

Are these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming?
Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?

The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British
Journalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times
article. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before
Turkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures
of people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.

Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these ""lies."" They are saying
""exaggeration."" That means ''somethings'' have happened but the
situation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu
town was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's
3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...

The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of
this massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.

Some of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability
to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.

Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print
no news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the
French TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag
was ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''

The age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots
of organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human
rights violations. International reactions must be made with international
cooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming
to be civilized.

Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the
right to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where
is the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals,
journalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries such
as France who are fast to claim leadership of ""human rights?""

Turkey is PERFECT, and no Turk has ever made a mistake.  He has proved to me at  
least that the land occupied by Turkey today, was ALWAYS lived in peacefully by  
Turks.  (Including Istanbul AKA Constantinople)  They treat their minorities  
like gods and have only done good while all of their evil neighbors attacked  
them.  Somehow, despite these evil neighbors capable of nothing but murder  
their population has exploded to almost 60 million in Turkey alone. (Note,  
Armenian worldwide population is approximately 7 million total)  I want to go  
to this heaven on earth and meet the race that has made Serdar possible, that  
has persevered, and has become a mecca for human rights lovers.  (Amnesty  
International must have bad sources, Turkey would never torture its citizens,  
treat minorities badly, or kidnap 7 foreign journalists last year alone, who  
incidentally are still missing), what I am trying to say is I WANT TO BE A  
TURK!!!!

Now back to reality.  I have once again been astounded by Serdars ability to  
ignore all truth, all truly difficult questions, and go on to his encyclopedia  
of quotes and sources that can be pasted into any note BY THE PAGE!  Anybody at  
all who has believed ANYTHING he has said, please step forward.  Let him know  
he hasn't been wasting his time, that SOMEBODY out there can be convinced by

---------------------------------------------
The Twins defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 5-4 today to conclude a three game
homestand with the Brew crew.  The Twins took two of three games in the series,
with scores as follows:

                  Tuesday April 20th    MN  10
                                        Mil  0

                    LP  - Hartley ( 0-1 )

                    WP - Deshaies (4-0)
                    Sa - Aguilera

Highlight/Low Lights of the Series:
------------------------------------
Jim Deshaies continues to be the surprise of not only the Twins, but of
the American League as well.  Going into today's game, Deshaies was 3-0
with a 1.74 ERA.  Deshaies allowed 2 Earned runs in 6 2/3 innings, meaning
his ERA will climb slightly.  Deshaies, who came to MN via a trade with
Philadelphia which sent David West there, continues to make Andy MacPhail
look like a true genius.

Willie Banks has put together two solid starts for the Twins, going 6.1 innings
on Monday while coasting on solid Twins hitting.  Deshaies and Banks now 
combine for 6 of the Twins eight victories, while Tapani/Mahomes/Erickson are
0-5.

Wednesday's game marked the first opposing left-handed starting pitcher for the
Twins this year (Rickey Bones).  The Twins teed off against both him and 
subsequent relief, including a Grand Slam by Kent Hrbek which pushed the lead
to 7-3.  The Twins pitching staff could not hold the lead, though, allowing
4 walks in the 7th inning, 2 of which scored and coming with bases loaded.
Tapani gave up one walk before being relieved, Guthrie two walks, and Mike
Hartley one walk before the inning was over.  This tied the game at 7-7, and
the Brew Crew rocked Mike Hartley for 3 runs in the top of the tenth to win
it.

Aguilera continues to be shaky against the Brew Crew.  6 of 20 career blown
saves have come against the Brew Crew, and today's game was shaky as well.
Coming into the ninth with a 5-2 lead, Aguilera gave up a solo HR to Vaughn,
then hits to Darryl Hamilton and Dickie Thon before finally retiring the
side.  Once again, the tying run made it to second base on Aggie.
Weak hearted Twins fans are advised not to watch Aggie in the ninth.

General News
-------------------------------------
Pedro Munoz continues to improve as an outfielder, playing in left field on
Tuesday's game.  He continues to bat weakly against right handed pitching,
though, which has limited his playing time.  Gene Larkin and JT Bruett(former
Gopher) have been playing right field, as both can bat left handed.

The Twins begin a three game series with the Detroit Tigers tomorrow.  Starting
Pitching is tentatively scheduled as Erickson, Mahomes, Banks.  The Detroit
Tigers have had TWO 20 run games in the last ten days, and should provide 
quite a challenge to the young MN pitching staff.

The Twins have 9 HR's this year, three each from Puckett, Hrbek, and Winfield,
the third, fourth, and fifth batters, respectively.

Brian Harper pegged 4 of the first 6 baserunners attempting to steal second
this year, and shows much improvement in this category.

Jim Deshaies has three pick-offs and one balk this year.  Some say he 
has the best 1st base move in baseball.  This move has enabled him to pitch
out of some tight early jams, and has certainly contributed to his 4-0 
start.  Watch to see if umpiring crews began calling the balk more tightly
in response to opposing team complaints about his leg kicking behind the
rubber on the pick-off move.

I didn't say that pitcher's fear of throwing strikes to guys like
McGwire, Bonds, and Frank Thomas was rational.  
I just said that it exists.


I don't know Alex Cole's batting style at all.   Some questions:
How tall is he?
Does he go into a crouch like Rickey Hederson/Pete Rose?
Does he foul off a lot of pitches like Brett Butler?
Does he take 1 or 2 strikes in each at bat?

It could be the Cole has a good batting ""eye"".

So?  Kratz was there - does that mean that he's a gang member?

Even in the most gang-infested areas, most of the residents ARE NOT
gang-members.


How was it obvious?  Were they not trying to hit the target?  Or, does
Kratz confuse ""marksmanship"" with ""trying to simulate a post""?  If so,
that excludes self-defense shooting, but the rest of us understand
that that exclusion would be an error.  (It excludes a lot of legit
""gun games"" as well.)


Sounds like practical pistol or maybe IPSC.  It also sounds like how a
self-defense shooter might well practice.  The only things that action
excludes are hunting and ""like a post"" shooting.  Kratz should get out

and the fan caught it.


Yes, I think he should have done more to get out of the way.  As much
as fans want to catch a ball, they really should be aware that winning
the game is more important.  As a Dodger fan, he has to be aware that
this is the home stadium, and that entails helping the home team win
in any way possible.  As soon as the ball was hit that far, his first
instinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it, not to try to catch
it himself, particularly when he is sitting that close.

I enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans, where they are against 
visiting team home runs so much, they actually throw them back on the
field.

Now, this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it or
not.  Sure, he probably screwed up, but the fan should realize his
first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win.

for that matter) up to count down 20 seconds between pitches and
the minute for warm-ups. But I think umpires should tell hitters
to go to hell if they step out to get the sign or whatever, and
instruct the pitcher to pitch. The same goes for pitchers. Umps
should tell them to pitch or feint within 20 seconds or a ball
will be called. That's the way it should be.

Two notes of interest from Texas:

The Tarrant Couonty ME (who is doing the autopsies) is well known for rendering
judgements that are contrary to the police view.  He presented evidence a few
years ago that a man who police said was pointing a gun at them actually had
his hands in the air.  This does not bode well for the boys in black.

The Texas Dept. of Public Saftey and the Texas Rangers have no great love for
the ATF.  I have heard them referred to as ""those fucking cowboys"".  The DPS
was totally squeezed out of the BD operation and resented being left as
""traffic cops"".  ATF now has two strikes against them.

Finally (I guess that makes three notes), rumour from Waco is that four ATF
agents were stopped by four Waco police cars and a DPS trooper after one of the
flashed ""an automatic weapon"" at a cop.  Lots of pissed of cops.  And you
wonder why there were so few cops really cheering on the ATF.",2,talk.politics.guns,"two notes of interest from texas: the tarrant couonty me (who is doing the autopsies) is well known for rendering judgements that are contrary to the police view . he presented evidence a few years ago that a man who police said was pointing a gun at them actually had his hands in the air . this does not bode well for the boys in black . the texas dept . of public saftey and the texas rangers have no great love for the atf . i have heard them referred to as ""those fucking cowboys"" . the dps was totally squeezed out of the bd operation and resented being left as ""traffic cops"" . atf now has two strikes against them . finally (i guess that makes three notes) , rumour from waco is that four atf agents were stopped by four waco police cars and a dps trooper after one of the flashed ""an automatic weapon"" at a cop . lots of pissed of cops . and you wonder why there were so few cops really cheering on the atf .",917

one that actually did.  But with the FBI/ATF just standing there watching
instead of being a part of the problem.  It then would have been very clear

The village I described was actually the closest I could come to
describing mine.  I agree there may be other villages where the civilian
population has deserted because it is too close to Israeli lines and
thus gets bombed more often.  In such villages often the only remaining 
inhabitants are guerillas and some elderly who have nowhere else to go.
But for the most part the typical South Lebanon village is more like
mine.  One where civilians and guerillas live together.  They are
often inhabiting the same house.  Many families are large, some
have members of the families involved in Hizollah, most others
are not.  That is what is so hard of South Lebanon, Israel is
not fighting an army with well drawn battle lines, but a guerilla
tyoe resistance which by definition and necessity blends with
the local populace.  Not because they are evil cowards that
use women and children as shields, but because that is the only
way one can fight a more powerful better equipped occupying army.


Hizbollah and Amal are now the main two militias.  Though
Hizbollah people tend to be more committed to resistrance
operation and better motivated by religious conviction.

  As to retaliation,

It may be a mixture of what we both say.  Sometimes Israel chooses
its targets carefully.  At other times it just sends its pilots on
sorties aimed at a town in general since it only knows that the 
attackers came from that specific village but has no further
intelligence.  On several occasions Israel retalliated against 
civilian refugee camps, even in North Lebanon, just to show
that it will not sit idly after its soldiers have been attacked.
Most of the time it directs the SLA to do the dirty work and
indiscriminately shell some Lebanese villages on the other side.
I have experienced this shelling myself on several occasions,
this is why the SLA militia is sometimes even more despised than 
Israeli troops.


I hope you are right on Israeli willingness to withdraw, but I still
contend that withdrawal would be the better course for Israel's
security, since it would reduce its  military losses, and I claim
that the Lebanese and Syrian gov'ts would be able to prevent any 
further attacks on Northern Israel.
 


Hmm...  Here we disagree on what serves Syria interests better.
I think Syria wants to have Lebanon all to itself.  It would
be willing to guarantee Northern Israel's security in return for
Israeli withdrawal.  I don't think Syria wants Israel to be
involved in its protectorate of Lebanon.  Syria is sitting at the
negotiating table because it has come to accept that and wants
to get a political resolution.  A renewal of hostilities
along the Lebanese front could put the whole ME peace negotiations
back in question.

afternoon press conference held at the new Mullins Center Arena - former
Boston College Asst. Coach Joe Mallen was awarded the 4 year, $85,000/year
contract as Head Coach for the UMass Minutemen. 

Mallen was the third viable pick for the position, right behind Jeff Jackson
(Lake Superior) and second behind Shawn Walsh (UMaine). Previous offers for 
the position were rumored to have been offered to the asst. coaches of
Brown, RPI and the head coach of the AHL Springfield Indians.

UMass hockey was disbanded in 1979 due to financial constraints that had
undermined the team's position over a period of years. In late November
of last year, the $52 million Mullins Sports Center was opened following
its one year construction deadline. 

The Minutemen are slated to play an independent Div II/Div III schedule this
upcoming winter before officially entering Hockey East for the Winter 1994
season. Mallen has yet to comment on player recruitment strategies or
potential team candidates for the Minutemen - it is expected that he will
leverage off his inside contacts within New England, the Bay State and
Europe to draw on competitive, top ice players for the University.

UMass has slated 18 hockey scholarships for the upcoming Fall semester ; 
expect to hear more from me as I hear more from my sources.

We have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris' contribu-
tion  from the rest of the team's.  There is only one way of determin-
ing ""best"" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at
the  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best
that day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the
most  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the
best of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-
cess  used to determine the ""best"" is the score of the game and it re-
lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method
inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that
is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.

To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-
solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B
in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.

If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has
done  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you
have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the
individual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the
only measure of ""best"" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base-
ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-
pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-
jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can
predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.


Exactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with
Clemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens.
I am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally
meaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on
his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.


You don't have to be rude.


For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point
of  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio
Elenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because
he   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed
that in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an
individual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of
comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per-
formance.

The stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  new
knowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better

Are you suggesting that we should forget the cold-blooded genocide of
2.5 million Muslim people by the Armenians between 1914 and 1920? But 
most people aren't aware that in 1939 Hitler said that he would pattern
his elimination of the Jews based upon what the Armenians did to Turkish
people in 1914.


     'After all, who remembers today the extermination of the Tartars?'
      (Adolf Hitler, August 22, 1939: Ruth W. Rosenbaum (Durusoy),

I refer to the Turks and Kurds as history's forgotten people. It does
not serve our society well when most people are totally unaware of
what happened in 1914 where a vicious society, run by fascist Armenians,
decided to simply use the phoniest of pretexts as an excuse, for wiping 
out a peace-loving, industrious, and very intelligent and productive 
ethnic group. What we have is a demand from the fascist government of
x-Soviet Armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our
people. And the only way we can do that is if we can catch hold of and 
not lose sight of the historical precedence in this very century. We 
cannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to 
keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as
to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because 
of their religion or their race. Which means that I support the claims 
of the Turks and Kurds to return to their lands in x-Soviet Armenia, 
to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.

Israeli nationalism (also known as Zionism) is the nationalism of the
Jewish people.  The Jewish people are not a new phenomenon at all.

Palestinean nationalism is the nationalism of Arab people.  Arabs have
been around for a long time.  They already  have some 2 dozen states,
large and small, covering 98% of the Middle East.

More specifically, Palestinean nationalism is the nationalism of Arabs
from the region of Palestine, just as Egyptian nationalism is the
nationalism of Arabs from the region of Egypt.  One Palestinean state
already exists in what was once known as Palestine: - it is called
Jordan. 

There is no justification in carving out a second and tiny Palestinean
state out of the only Jewish state, itself very, very small, just as
there is no justification in carving out another American state out of
Mexico.

Nice try Deepak, but ""tough Whaler squad"" should have clued you in to the
fact that my Leaf woofing was tongue-in-cheek.

If playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then
it is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive times
in 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is, some things will
be carried over that might dissipate during the regular season.  But that is
only for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with
injuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really
rather be playing golf, don't really give a damn.  Of course I can't say this
for sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I
don't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically
human attitudes.  

With the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing 
money by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff
""take"" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely
to consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are
going to come back with ""winning spirit"" and all of that crap but these
players are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the 
game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make
a decent living. 

Of course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is 
being paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his
job well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.

The second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions
of the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top 
after the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely
accord victory to the team that has remained healthy and ""hot"".  The 
emphasis on the playoffs, with their ""sudden death"" appeal has been promoted
by the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh
loses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the
league over the year.  They proved it.

Not acceptable. Syria and Lebanon have a right to determine if
they wish to return to the situation prior to the French invasion
where they were both part of the same ""mandate territory"" - read
colony.

Israel has no right to determine what happens in Lebanon. Invading another
country because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almost
all wars of aggression have started.



Again territorial expansion by force.



The UN defines them as occupied. They are recognised as such by every
nation on earth (excluding one small caribean island).



So the Adam thinks that peace is possible with continued occupation and 
a continued military presence? That is a completely unsustainable situation
because the USA is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the
Israeli ecconomy any more. There is no money for such an occupation.



They were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return
of the occupied territories. Machiavelli described the reasoning in the
Prince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud
beleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous
population.

The pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the 
redefinition of much land used in common as ""public land"". The assertion
that the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to
an invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an
excuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought
in to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the
Geneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories
must not be changed. 

No amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists
will change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all of
those that actually have any power have condemned this practice.



Theyu also are a liability. We are talking about civilian encampments that
would last no more than hours against tanks,


Don't fool yourself. It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the
negotiating table. Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf
they insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else.

If the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would have
cut the money supply.


Not at all. They can chose to live in an arab state or return to Israel.


The existence of a comunity does not give the right for another country
to annexe territory, not in Bosnia, not in the West Bank.


Unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of 48 there will be no peace.
Araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else.


The real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty. Since the
Palestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it
is this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be the
return of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the
dismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against
non-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state. 

The irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has
a non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the
Israeli state is going to be forced inot the same position. This will mean
outlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying
or using much of the land.

   Another pair of suggestions:
   1. Remove the Balk rule.  It is the runners responsibility to stay ""safe""
      no matter what the pitcher does.

   2. If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time (X = 3 to 5)
      without successfully picking off the runner, the runner advances a base
      as if walked.

This last suggestion will probably increase the number of stolen bases
considerably.  Suppose the pitcher uses up (N-1) of his N pick-off
attempts.  The runner can probably stretch his lead off the base,
given that there will be extra pressure on the pitcher to get it
right this time.

Would this suggestion apply to pick-off attempts per pitch, per
batter, or per base runner (on the same base)?

This is a fine strategy if you expect to run away with the division.
But the Giants are going to need every break they can get, if they
want too hold that lead.  I don't think they can afford to be

while we might be able to improve the results, we don't think it is

Wiggins, Alan?

But that's besides the point.  I'm sure people would feel slightly
sympathetic for Rickey if he were killed.  But, they would also be
criticizing him a lot more for his actions.

Example?  

How about Jose Canseco?  He gets a couple of speeding tickets, and all
of the sudden his attitude is awful.  What the hell do speeding tickets
have to do with clubhouse influence anyway?  So why do sportswriters
talk about it all the time.

Or Brian Hunter and Keith Mitchell?  Both of whom had DWI problems
towards the end of last year.  (Two years ago?)  It was cited as a sign
of their immaturity, etc.

about how bad it was for the Phillies, but I NEVER read anywhere

Final Solution for the Gaza ghetto ?
------------------------------------

While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto, they
repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and
attempt to starve the Gazans.

The Gaza strip, this tiny area of land with the highest population
density in the world, has been cut off from the world for weeks.
The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of
Gaza, some 700.000 people, by denying them the right to leave the
strip and seek work in Israel.

While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the
Ghetto, no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help
the Gazan resistance. The only help given to Gazans by Israeli
Jews, only dozens of people, is humanitarian assistance.

The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is
recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of
justice. A population denied basic human rights is entitled to
rise up against its tormentors.

As is known, the Israeli regime is considering Gazans unworthy of
Israeli citizenship and equal rights in Israel, although they are
considered worthy to do the dirty work in Israeli hotels, shops
and fields. Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in
Israel. They may not live there, for these areas are reserved for
the Master Race.

The Nazi regime accorded to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto the
right to self- administration.  They selected Jews to pacify the
occupied population and preventing any form of resistance. Some
Jewish collaborators were killed. Israel also wishes to rule over
Gaza through Arab collaborators.

As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible
with basic human rights and international law, that of becoming
Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for
self-determination, it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish
society does not consider Gazans full human beings. This attitude
is consistent with the attitude of the Nazis towards Jews. The
current policies by the Israeli government of cutting off Gaza are
consistent with the wish publicly expressed by Prime Mininister
Yitzhak Rabin that 'Gaza sink into the sea'. One is led to ask
oneself whether Israeli leaders entertain still more sinister
goals towards the Gazans ? Whether they have some Final Solution
up their sleeve ?

I urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever
they can to help the Gazans regain their full human, civil and
political rights, to which they are entitled as human beings.

   In the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied
   Lebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder.  It is 
   disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich
   or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed 
   solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.

I agree that the death of three soldiers on a patrol etc... is
not terrorism.  That having been said, lets continue.

   [snip]
   imagine ????  It is NOT a ""terrorist camp"" as you and the Israelis like 
   to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer
   in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....

I would not argue that all or even most of the villages are ""terrorist
camps"".  There are however some which come very close to serving that
purpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way
prior to the invasion. 

   SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of
   the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not 
   know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often
   suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are
   supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and
   ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps
   for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured
   by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages
   of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they
   are back they announce that they bombed a ""terrorist  hideout"" where
   an 8 year old girl just happened to be.

Some of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you
describe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area,
backed by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollah
and Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  As to retaliation,
while mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate
bombing, which would have produced major casualties.

   Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that
   we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance
   on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING 
   ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real 
   leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.

Well, here we disagree.  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if
the Lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to police
it and prevent further attacks.

   This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to
   realize that the concept of a ""buffer zone"" aimed at protecting
   its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more
   Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel
   would have resulted in.  

Actually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is no
longer civilian and now primarily military though.

   There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese
   goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such 
   circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is
   capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did
   in all other parts of Lebanon.

No, the Syrian gov't is more than happy to have Israel sink into another
Lebanese morass.  I could elaborate if necessary.

   I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing
   CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.

No, but it is regretable, as is the whole situation.

I don't have a history handy, but I don't recall that the preponderance
of ROY's come from winning teams.  In fact, I think team performance is
generally irrelevant, as almost always the most deserving candidate wins.
Am I wrong?

And he is not necessarily on a losing team.  While the Angels' staff
is still very weak, their everyday lineup is doing quite well, thank
you.  Snow is playing great.  Salmon is learning to make the adjustments.
Easley appears fine, but even if he's not Flora is ready to come up.
Between Gonzales and Gruber they'll manage the hot corner.  Polonia
and Curtis are steady and heady.  Even Myers and Orton are contributing.

Personally, I think they can finish over .500 which makes them a 
winning team.

",0,rec.sport.baseball,the subject line says it all . what is the rule that qualifies a pitcher as making a save ?,91

I'm not quite sure how these numbers are generated.  It appears that in
a neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two
home runs).  Or do they?  What is ""equivalent average?""

One thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC took
away some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for
doubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you
expect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, 
hit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his
value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  


Felix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park.
I would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player.
Maybe .330/.550 .  Not even close.


I'd put him about there too.  

Note: I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he
was always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so 
at baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn't
winning.

Note 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a
mistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group)
with respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).

We find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major
and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.
Their are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;
the lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent
the player has left college ball, etc.

Now of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of ""error.""  Sometimes
a player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.
Some hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (Oddibe
McDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are
real reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)
involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting
and so on.

But still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.
One of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background
of the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is
that all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing
ball.  Their backgrounds are similar.

What hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player
with a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a
Bo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so
on, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard
assumptions fit this person slowly?

It hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players.
(It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after
all, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually
make completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.
""Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,"" they say.  Well,
what happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean?
It might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than
Tuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in
Atlanta than Greenville.  

Then again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank
this year, live up to those poor MLE's.  But you guys DON'T KNOW.  What's 
worse, you don't know that you don't.  And you don't know that there are 
other players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties 
again.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  It's not.
It's got some error.

Oh well.

Well, apparently we have another son of Dro 'the Butcher' to contend with. 
You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on
distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel 
that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum 
you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to 
another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact.

I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line, 
lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan 
to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is 
nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in 
x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship, 
that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel 
free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists,
the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian
criminal organizations.

x-Soviet Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million 
Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. 
You, and those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.

During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, 
the Armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide, 
tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against 
the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and 
deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland.

The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance
of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

Serdar Argic",3,talk.politics.mideast,"well , apparently we have another son of dro 'the butcher' to contend with . you should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries . if you feel that you can simply act as an armenian governmental crony in this forum you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed . this is not a lecture to another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist , but a fact . i will dissect article-by-article , paragraph-by-paragraph , line-by-line , lie-by-lie , revision-by-revision , written by those on this net , who plan to 'prove' that the armenian genocide of 2 .5 million turks and kurds is nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide . we are neither in x-soviet union , nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship , that employs the dictates of hitler to quell domestic unrest . also , feel free to distribute all responses to your nearest asala/sdpa/arf terrorists , the armenian pseudo-scholars , or to those affiliated with the armenian criminal organizations . x-soviet armenian government got away with the genocide of 2 .5 million turkish men , women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide . you , and those like you , will not get away with the genocide's cover-up . during the first world war and the ensuing years - 1914-1920 , the armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide , tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against the turks and kurds by savagely murdering 2 .5 million muslims and deporting the rest from their 1 ,000 year homeland . the attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of genocide in the 20th century acted upon an entire people . this event is incontrovertibly proven by historians , government and international political leaders , such as u .s . ambassador mark bristol , william langer , ambassador layard , james barton , stanford shaw , arthur chester , john dewey , robert dunn , papazian , nalbandian , ohanus appressian , jorge blanco villalta , general nikolayef , general bolkovitinof , general prjevalski , general odiselidze , meguerditche , kazimir , motayef , twerdokhlebof , general hamelin , rawlinson , avetis aharonian , dr . stephan eshnanie , varandian , general bronsart , arfa , dr . hamlin , boghos nubar , sarkis atamian , katchaznouni , rachel bortnick , halide edip , mccarthy , w . b . allen , paul muratoff and many others . j . c . hurewitz , professor of government emeritus , former director of the middle east institute (1971-1984) , columbia university . bernard lewis , cleveland e . dodge professor of near eastern history , princeton university . halil inalcik , university professor of ottoman history & member of the american academy of arts & sciences , university of chicago . peter golden , professor of history , rutgers university , newark . stanford shaw , professor of history , university of california at los angeles . thomas naff , professor of history & director , middle east research institute , university of pennsylvania . ronald jennings , associate professor of history & asian studies , university of illinois . howard reed , professor of history , university of connecticut . dankwart rustow , distinguished university professor of political science , city university graduate school , new york . john woods , associate professor of middle eastern history , university of chicago . john masson smith , jr . , professor of history , university of california at berkeley . alan fisher , professor of history , michigan state university . avigdor levy , professor of history , brandeis university . andreas g . e . bodrogligetti , professor of history , university of california at los angeles . kathleen burrill , associate professor of turkish studies , columbia university . roderic davison , professor of history , george washington university . walter denny , professor of history , university of massachusetts . caesar farah , professor of history , university of minnesota . tom goodrich , professor of history , indiana university of pennsylvania . tibor halasi-kun , professor emeritus of turkish studies , columbia university . justin mccarthy , professor of history , university of louisville . jon mandaville , professor of history , portland state university (oregon) . robert olson , professor of history , university of kentucky . madeline zilfi , professor of history , university of maryland . james stewart-robinson , professor of turkish studies , university of michigan . . . . . . . .so the list goes on and on and on . . . . . serdar argic",4615

I recently learned that Don Kates was going to be in Boston to give a talk
at the Harbard Law School about the Waco situation.  (Of course, this was
all set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy
conclusion.)  So, yesterday I went to hear him.  What follows is a rough
summary of what I think I heard him say, which should not be taken as
exactly what he actually said...

Kates started by saying that since he didn't know any more about the fire
than the audience did (it had just happened the day before), he would not
discuss that, but would concentrate on the original raid.

Koresh definitely was not playing with a full deck.  But so what?  This
isn't the first time that the leader of a new, small religious group has
been ridiculed by the public.  Extreme religious views nearly always fuel
hatred and mistrust.  The first amendment applies, maybe especially, to
people like Koresh.

Lengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the US.
There were none until about 1830, when they began in metropolitan areas.
Police originally were not armed; if they found a crime in progress, they
called local armed citizens to help.  Many began to carry arms for
protection despite regulations against them, eventually the laws were
changed to allow them to carry guns.  The original intent was to have many
small police departments, jealous of one another and competitive, but not
large enough to be a threat to liberty, hence the plethora of
organizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard.  When the
FBI was started, agents did not have the authority oto carry guns (they
were to be, after all, a bureau of investigation, not a police force).
""All police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that
power.""

The BATF started as a tax collection agency, whose primary job was to raid
illegal stills.  When the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners
no longer found their trade no longer profitable, many illegal stills
disappeared, and the BATF needed something else to do to justify its
existence, so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores.
Around the time when the BATF's annual budget is under review, the media
is alerted by the BATF to come to such-and-such a place, where at a
pre-arranged time, a bunch of cars full of BATF agents roar up to the door
and the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a
gun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly.  The media isn't
invited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork, but
if any irregularities are found, the media gets to cover the agents
removing armfuls of guns from the premises, and the luckless FFL in
chains.

The Waco incident happened a few weeks before BATF's budget was up for
review.

Kates' opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad, and
that the BATF never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot
at, or they would have planned the raid differently (not sending 100
agents over open ground with no cover, for example), and would have had
some medical personnel on hand.

He confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for Koresh's arrest
in connection with a murder charge, and the local sheriff called him on
the phone and explained about it.  Koresh sais, ok, come pick me up, and
the sheriff did, temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could
be tested.  Koresh was later cleared, release, and presumably got his guns
back.  At least at that time, he was rational enough to be approached
rationally, and behaved in a reasonable manner.

The BATF didn't take into account that, unlike most of the FFL's they
audit, Koresh was actually paranoid, and fostered paranoia in his
followers.  Thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them, and
they reacted accordingly.

With respect to the original warrant, it had not been unsealed when Kates
was giving his talk, so he could not comment on it, except to mention that
the BATF has been known to not double-check the veractiy of their
informants, if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant.  He had
more to say about the way the warrant was served, which may have been
completely illegal.  Apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to
knock on the door and announce that you're an officer with a warrant for
thus-and-so; if they don't open the door and the evidence is flushable,
then it is ok to break in the door.  But since it is hard to flush guns
down the toilet, there may have been no justification for the BATF
breaking in the way they did.  If the constitutional rights of the
Davidians were violated by an invalid warrant, or by an improperly served
warrant, then the Davidians may have been justified in their actons.  A
close look at one of the original films shows that one BATF agent _may_
have shot himself by accident when entering the building; if so, this was
the first shot fired!

The role of the media could have been a whole lot worse.  After an initial
position on the side of the BATF, the media began to come around to the
view that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held
off a bad, possibly illegal attack.  A real cynic might say that the FBI
went in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was
beginning to change sides, and the FBI wanted to act before they lost the
public's sympathy.

Should the BATF be abolished?  No.  Police agencies _should_ be numerous,
diverse, inefficient, decentralized, etc.  Better a few inept accidents
like this, than a move toward a single, large, well-organized,
well-trained, powerful, domestic police force, which would eventually have
even more tragic results.

	For example If it is the bottom of the 8th inning and Clemens is
pithching. The Red Sox are leading 4-1 and Clemens has just givin up a hit. So,
there is a man on first, the batter, and the batter on deck could tie the game
with a homer.  If Jeff Russel came in, (The Red Sox reliever), and finished the

Actually, just after the FIRST world war, many Muslims were killed by Serbs.
Under Serbian-led regime between the two world wars, many Croats were
also killed (especially during the dictatorship introduced on Jan. 6, 1929).
Some Croats formed a resistance movement ""Ustashas"" (Insurgents) and
were forced into exile, to fascist Italy, which sheltered them.  In exile,
they practiced a terrorist approach to liberating Croatia; while Croats in
Croatia followed the approach of peaceful negotiations under the leadership
of Vladko Macek.  After the Axis powers took control in the SECOND world
war, Vladko Macek refused to collaborate, so Ustashas were brought in 
to run the newly formed puppet state.  This state included both Croatia and
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and its ideology saw Muslims as the best Croats
(""flowers of Croatian people"").  Some Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina
therefore joined Ustashas.  However, even more others did not; they
joined Tito's Partisans.    The Ustashas membership peaked at 
less than 1% of Croat and Muslim population of that area at that time.

After WWII, Muslims were still considered a religious minority descended
from Croats or Serbs who converted to Islam centuries ago.  But, in 1968,
it was decided that forcing Muslims to declare their nationality as
either Serbs or Croats is not a good policy.  Dobrica Cosic, the current
president of the rump Yugoslavia, was strongly opposed, and sought to
prevent the category ""Muslim"" (in an ethnic sense) from appearing on the
next census.  He was criticized and expelled from the party.  So, since
that time, Bosnian Muslims are considered a separate nationality, although
some still deny this and insist that they choose either Serb or Croat

You started it...


You most certainly did!


Sabo is clearly a better hitter than Samuel.  Yet you would pinch-hit
Samuel because you predict that Samuel will be a clutch hitter and
Sabo will be a choke hitter.  Right?  I'd call that ""predicting the
future"".


Right.  I would have used aspects of prior performance which have been
shown to be consistent in the past.  Overall performance, L/R splits,
even matching hitting/pitching styles.  All of these will give me some
advantage if used properly.

EVEN IF ALL ELSE WERE EQUAL, there would be no advantage gained by
looking at past clutch performance.  And in this case, everything else
pointed to Sabo.


That comes down to the same thing.  When Perez left Sabo in, he
was predicting the future, the next AB.  He was predicting that
Sabo was more likely to get a hit than Samuel.

By supporting the swap, you are predicting the opposite.


Well, yes.  You are aware of its existance.  You claim to be incapable
of understanding it (though I suspect you are simply unwilling).  Yet
you rather forcefully state the opposite.  You don't seem to think the
work is worth reading (yet you obviously feel the topic is important).
I'd say this is insulting.


RIGHT!  This is the beef.  It has not proven to be an indicator of
future performance under *any* circumstances.  At least none that
we've been able to come up with.  If you know of some where it *is* an
indicator of future performance, please let us in on your secret.


Most certainly.  As I have repeatedly stated, if you can come up with
a study which even *hints* at a consistent clutch ability, I would
love it!  However the straightforward attempts at such a study have
all failed miserably.


Well, it was a stupid argument.  (Are you honestly debating that???)
Sure, we know Sabo didn't get a hit.  We have no idea whether Samuel
would have done any better or not.  One AB most certainly doesn't
prove anything!


Is this simply a prediction for Chris Sabo for this year?  Or is this
a prediction for *all* batters who have, over the past few years, hit
(xxx amount?)  worse in the clutch than overall?

If you mean the first, then as you say, we'll just have to wait and
see.  But the second is a much stronger statement.  In fact, it
suggests a rule.  We can then test this rule on past data to see if it
worked for recent years.  I think you will agree that if the rule
didn't work last year or the year before, that it is unlikely to do
any better this year.  Right?


I'm not going to get into case analysis.  Sure, you can find somebody
who hit poorly from '89-'91 and then hit poorly in '92 as well.  You
can also find those who hit poorly from '89-'91 and then hit *well* in

Gambler's fallacy.  Unless there is reason to expect consistency, a
run proves nothing.  Can you give us a reason to expect clutch BA to
correlate from one year to the next?  I've seen a detailed study of
why I *shouldn't* expect it to correlate.

Ethiopian Jews and not-quite Jews

The Israeli press has published items about Ethiopian 
Jews waiting in camps in Addis Ababa for immigration to 
Israel, who are dying of starvation. The following are 
excerpts from an interview with the former general 
director of the JDC project for development and welfare 
of Ethiopian Jews, Kobi Friedman (Hadashot, 21 April 
1993), who has stated that ""there are people dying in 
Addis Ababa, but they are converts to Christianity"":

""Hadashor published the item about the dying Jews after 
viewing a video tape filmed last week in Adis Ababa. 
How do you know that they are actually converts to 
Chritianity ?

""If there are Jews on the tape, then I don't know what to 
say. I am speaking from experience when I say that those 
who remained in Ethiopia are Christians. I know that

Whatever you say.  I think it's just 12 games into the season myself, so
I'm going to wait a bit before calling names.


I expect that Dave Otto will be a really bad pitcher, and I have no
idea why Simmons ever wanted him.  On the other hand, I expect him to
release Otto if he doesn't turn things around pretty fast.  (BTW,
Otto's game score for that 0 IP stinker was only 22, which points out
a problem with the method since Otto's performance was infinitely bad,
and excruciatingly prolonged.)


I think Merced's rookie year was a bit flukey, but aren't you willing to
give him some more at bats (and Tomlin a few more starts) before acting
so gloomy?


No he didn't.  Walk is a time bomb.  He has no stuff whatsoever, and when
the league finally realizes this, it won't be pretty at all.


Don't be so fast.  Doughty is the guy who signed Steve Buechele, which
was a move that threatened to bury Kevin Young in the minors.
Meanwhile, I'm not sure whether Doughty or Simmons signed Martin as a
six-year free agent before the 1992 season.


Twice through the rotation, and you've given up?  Yikes.


But so has his age, at least in baseball terms.  The useful half-life
of a 34- year-old injury-prone catcher can't be much longer than a year.


But he wanted to be a Dodger, and felt he had something to prove after his
disastrous 1992.  I don't think there was any chance for the Bucs to sign
him.


He certainly wasn't last year.


Hey, that's the ""Skates Smith"" package deal.  Anybody who acquires
Lonnie for his defense or base-running (particularly at this stage) is
a real weirdo.


If that's the goal of the team ownership, than I don't see why Sauer
gets a zero for making his boss happy.  I don't know what he has or
hasn't said about revenue sharing, so I can't comment there.


It's annoying, but since Leyland seems to have been pushing for them
to retain Jeff King, it was probably unavoidable.  Meanwhile, I think
bigger accomplishments of Simmons' tenure were getting some value for
John Smiley, not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch
last year, drafting well in 1992, letting the rookies show something
in 1993.  Foley, Smith, and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement
parts, which means that even if fail it hasn't done serious damage to
the Bucs' future.


Does this mean that the Bucs lost the initial arbitration case?  I
never heard the outcome of this.  When will the final verdict be in on
this?


I'm not sure who was the idiot in this case, so I don't know who to
blame.  It might have been Doug Danforth, after all.  In fact, I
*seriously* suspect it was Doug Danforth, who has shown his
willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is
pointed at his feet.

The last year before Bryan Murray took over, the Wings did not make the
playoffs.  While they had been considered a possible contender when Jacques
Demers first arrived, in his last two years they were, respectively,
embarrassed in the first round by Chicago, and then failed to make the 
playoffs (at a time, a might add, when there were only five teams in the
Norris).

It's true that Vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before 
Quinn came, but in those years the Smythe Division was a lot--I mean *a lot*--
tougher division than the Norris, also known as the ""Snorris"", division.
Vancouver had to play Edmonton and Calgary, both very legitimate Stanley
Cup contenders, eight times a year, while Detroit got to play such 
powerhouses as Toronto and Minnesota.  Now, Edmonton is hardly even a force
in the league, and the Smythe even has the mighty San Jose sharks, while
over this same period of time in which Vancouver was improving, so was 
everybody in the Norris (except St. Louis).  Detroit had to improve just
to keep up with the competition in their division.  They had to improve *a
lot* to get better than their competition in the Norris.

Bryan Murray inherited a team with very little talent.  For really good
players, they had Yzerman, Burr, and Probert, and that was about it.  (And
no doubt some will dispute whether Burr and Probert were that good). The
rest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans.  The only reason
they got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to the
coaching of Demers, who, at least at first, got every last ounce of effort
possible out of his team.  Then, even his coaching began to degrade.


There are a number of reasons why Detroit wasn't in as bad a shape standings
wise when Murray took over as Vanc. was when Quinn took over, some of which
I outlined above, but Murray did not have any better personnel to work with
at the outset than did Quinn, with the exception of Yzerman.  And one player
cannot alone make a team into a Stanley Cup contender, as I'm sure everyone
reading this will agree.  

We'll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they
face each other in the conference final (assuming they don't get knocked out,
like last year).

Come again? The image-conscious Armenians sorely feel a missing 
glory in their background. Armenians have never achieved statehood 
and independence, they have always been subservient, and engaged 
in undermining schemes against their rulers. They committed 
genocide against the Muslim populations of Eastern Anatolia 
and x-Soviet Armenia before and during World War I and fully 
participated in the extermination of the European Jewry 
during World War II. Belligerence, genocide, back-stabbing, 
rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the 
Armenian history. To obliterate these episodes the Armenians 
engaged in tailoring history to suit their whims. In this zeal 
they tried to cover up the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million 
Turks and Kurds before and during World War I.

And the justice is long overdue.

       Two questions:  When was this, and do you have the relevant
numbers.  (Please note, this is *not* in any way an indication I don't
believe you or that you're not correct, but when the drop occured is
relevant.)
   

       The primary objection (beyond ones based on the ideal of
RKBA that it is simply not something the government should do) is
that it makes guns a play-thing and tool of the rich and connected.
It discriminates against the poor.

       Is self-defense considered appropriate, and if so, under what
conditions?  (Are you allowed, for instance to get a gun for protection
if you're going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular
basis or have been threatened.)


       This has been suggested in the U.S., and generally supported among
gun owners.  What many object to is that many, if not most, proposals
contain a sort of ""gotcha"" clause which allows an arbitrary denial, even
if you qualify in every way.


       At this point, it should be pointed out that in general
a driver's licence in the U.S. is for the most part nothing like its
European counterpart.  I understand getting one is far more difficult
there than here.  In the U.S. it's a joke. 

       But my usual objection is that you're discussing two different
things.  For instance, in the U.S. a driver's license is a permit
to operate a motor vehicle on a public road.  It is not necessary
to own one, or to operate it on private property.  That is, the
ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise
from the government's legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations
for behavior on public lands.  A permit to own an automobile, for instance,
which is far closer an analogy, would be a much harder thing to get
past legally, since it wouldn't be based on making regulations on public
property, but in restricting activity on private property.              


        This varies *widely*.  (One thing I think Europeans have
a difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions,
where the laws from one state to another can be as radically different
as from one country in Europe to another).

        Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives.  Some allow
concealed.  Some prohibit both, or allow one or the other.  And it can
be either a state or local restriciton.       


       The question must be asked:  Is the right of *this* individual
affecting the rights of this *other* individual.  What we usually
get is that the rights of this *group* (meaning some individuals within
this group, here defined as ""people who own guns,"") are adversely affecting 
the rights of some other group.  

       If for instance, ""Bob"" were using his gun to attack ""Steve,"" you'd
have a point.  But essentially what we're discussing is that becuase
some person who qualifies as a member of the group ""people who own
guns"" then some third person, perhaps in another *time zone* is told
that their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else's
rights.  It's like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited
by one.


       The issue is crime, violence, and murder.  The question is to
what extent guns and gun legislation impact those.


       Of course not.  It would be nice if we didn't have to fear that
other people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us.
But currently we don't have that option.  Nor do I expect we will.


       No state does.  In any case, there's a limit to which the state
may enforce it's ""wisdom"" on me.  Freedom in general is an unwise
concept.  If you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be
""unwise"" then freedom becomes a meaningless concept.
   

       I'll raise my hand against driver's licenses.  As currently
implemented they're a waste of time and little more than revanue
generation for the State and ignored by a startling number of
drivers.  It does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is
necessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody
else killed, or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year
old will have picked up riding around in his parents car.

       But, as I mentioned, they're two different things.

       In terms of PEAK, and I repeat PEAK years, Winfield has Done it  
all. He has batted in the 340's for a season, drove in 100 and more runs  
many times in a row before his injury. Consistently hit at or near 300  
while knocking in 35 home runs. Have you even LOOKED at Dave Winfield's  
slugging percentage for three or 4 of his best seasons. I still think that  
dave was one of the BETTER of all time, but obviously not the best. He was  
one of the best athletes evr to play baseball. He hit line drives that hit  
the scoreboard in left-center field, a feat np one has done in the new  
Stadium. Heck, only 2 or 3 other people have hit it over that green fence  
since it has been remodeled. He could field, had a bullet arm, and his  
hitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields, and barry bonds  
of last season. He is older now, and slowing down, takes more of an  
uppercut to lift the ball out of the park, but he will always be my hero,  
and my idol. There is nothing that could make me happier than George  
inviting Dave back to the Bronx to play his last year of ball with the  
Yankees. Of course, he will most likely refuse the offer, but who knows?  
For 3 million dollars, he'll play. Heck they are giving gallego 2.5  
million this year, having Dave as their DH, while leaving him time to play  
the field when Tartabull is injured, or Nokes and mass are traded, should

2177,"Disclaimer -- This is for fun.

In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called
""stolen hits"", defined as a play made that ""an average fielder would not
make with average effort.""  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted
by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats
for the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as ""Plays Kurt
Stillwell would not have made.""

OK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff,
fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we
replaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out
making ability, how many extra hits would go by?

To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net
Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league
average fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double
Plays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).

Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or
DCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.
I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which
should represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't
take it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this
article.

The short version -- definition of terms
HS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell
NHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder
NDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder
NEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder
DCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.
DOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.

DCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)
Why such a bizzare formula?  Basically, it's designed to be added into the
OPS, with the idea that ""a run prevented is as important as a run scored"".
The extra outs are factored into OBP, while the extra bases removed are 
factored into SLG.  That's why I used PA and AB as the divisors.

As I have read this net the last few days, I am continually amazed at the 
pronouncements of baseball prowess by many individuals.  Especially when it 
comes down to saying that the Bosox haven't a prayer.  As a long time Red Sox
fan, I will simply say:  The Impossible Dream Year - 1967 for those of you
with short memories. short lives, or both.  

To be a Red Sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism
from those who only follow 'the hot team'.  This statement is supported based
on the increased number of 'Brave Woofers' out on the net.  A true fan of a 
team, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean
years, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.  

Yeah, so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86.  Who cares if
Clemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower.  The
fact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans
supported them.  Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of 
detracters come from all over.  So what!  Let them play and we will see what 
happens come September.  The Red Sox may not be that good, but they are certainly 
not that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the World Series, after all,
remember the `69 Mets?  Who would have given them a chance to even make it that
far, let alone beat Baltimore.

Let's face it, Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Football
and Basketball.  Because of this, one can never say with absolute certainity what
the outcome will be over the course of 162 games.",0,rec.sport.baseball,"as i have read this net the last few days , i am continually amazed at the pronouncements of baseball prowess by many individuals . especially when it comes down to saying that the bosox haven't a prayer . as a long time red sox fan , i will simply say: the impossible dream year - 1967 for those of you with short memories . short lives , or both . to be a red sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism from those who only follow 'the hot team' . this statement is supported based on the increased number of 'brave woofers' out on the net . a true fan of a team , any team , will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean years , and be amply rewarded when the time is right . yeah , so what if buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86 . who cares if clemens told cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower . the fact is , they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans supported them . now that it appears that they are on lean times , the number of detracters come from all over . so what! let them play and we will see what happens come september . the red sox may not be that good , but they are certainly not that bad , either and they do have a chance to win the world series , after all , remember the `69 mets ? who would have given them a chance to even make it that far , let alone beat baltimore . let's face it , baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than football and basketball . because of this , one can never say with absolute certainity what the outcome will be over the course of 162 games .",1623

2484,"The Blues scored two power-play goals in 17 seconds in the third period
and the beat the Chicago Blackhawks 4-3 Sunday afternoon at Chicago Stadium.
Brendan Shanahan tied the game 3-3 and Brett Hull scored the game winner 17
seconds later. Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals.
Brian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good
goaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the
stretch to preserve the Blues lead.

The Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and
taking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty
on Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the
blue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired
a long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After
the goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks
10-9 in the first period.

Jeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on
the left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour
came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown
collected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.

Two minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a
short-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy
Roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass
across the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.

Noonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1.
Stephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat
Stephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan
deflected the puck in the net.

Denny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the
rebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for
the shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards
to Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues
outshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.

With the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked
up a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith
was called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.

The Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into
the two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot,
and Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and
passed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp
angle.

Just 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson
Emerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with
two Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the
slot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.

The Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph
made some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy
Murray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game.
The Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the
puck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held
on to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period,
totaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent
in the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays, and scored twice on
on four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in
the league. They rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play.
 
The game was carried live on ABC, the first time an NHL game other than an
All-Star game has been shown on network television since May 24, 1980, when
CBS carried Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals.

The best-of-seven series continues Wednesday in Chicago and Friday and Sunday

Sorry, Nelson, but you forgot to ask me. If you check the THN stats for
Kansas City, you'll find that Larry has been playing for the games, having
played in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the
4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM). Not exactly invisible.


Well, having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times, this isn't quite
accurate. He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing,
which was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because
he knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which
point he disclosed the injury. Since he didn't disclose it, the Sharks and
he disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not
reporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as
injured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped
him down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly
not with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a
no-no).

Very nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was
hurt. I expect he'll surface with another team at some point (probably
another expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of
his career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players
motivated. Unfortunately, he played himself out of the Sharks future with a
bad judgement call.




Always gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio), but
hustle isn't always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to me
one night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to
hold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto's
neck and another wrapped around Otto's stick arm. Otto casually turned
around and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter
wasn't there. Hustle can only cover size so far.

The Sharks have told me, point blank, that he's gone for good (ditto HUbie
McDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me
""you have to make room for the kids"". Carter, in fact, refused to report to
K.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defacto
retirement, but I haven't heard anything official. His only hope in hockey
now is the Gulls.



Because, at least from the games I saw him in, he was outmatched and looked
fairly lost on the ice. I think he shows potential, but I didn't think he

Agreed (BTW, I still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you
wish they'd performed than how they actually performed. I wonder whether you
can really judge talent from radio and television, Nelson? I know I have
trouble, since you don't see the off-puck action. your views from home and
my views from the ice differ in numerous ways)



Coffee. Coffey is with the Red Wings.



You? Nah... 

He was seriously unimpressive, even as a tough guy (his rep). However, as
few games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless, I hate
to judge the talent too quickly. Butn in Dody's case, I""m tempted to make an
exception.

But I won't.

You must be a new Armenian clown. You are counting on ASALA/SDPA/ARF 
crooks and criminals to prove something for you? No wonder you are in 
such a mess. That criminal idiot and 'its' forged/non-existent junk has 
already been trashed out by Mutlu, Cosar, Akgun, Uludamar, Akman, Oflazer 
and hundreds of people. Moreover, ASALA/SDPA/ARF criminals are responsible 
for the massacre of the Turkish people that also prevent them from entering 
Turkiye and TRNC. SDPA has yet to renounce its charter which specifically 
calls for the second genocide of the Turkish people. This racist, barbarian 
and criminal view has been touted by the fascist x-Soviet Armenian government 
as merely a step on the road to said genocide.

Following is the article that Davidian claims that Hasan Mutlu is a liar:






[some parts are deleted]




				- - -




Receiving this message, I checked the reference, L.Kuper,""Genocide..."" and
what I have found was totally consistent with what Davidian said.The book
was like ""voice of Armenian revolutionists"" and although I read the whole book,
I could not find the original quota.
But there was one more thing to check:The original posting of Mutlu.I found 
the original article of Mutlu.It is as follows:



     ======================================================================
    ======

QUATO IS THE SAME, REFERENCE IS DIFFERENT !

DAVIDIAN LIED AGAIN, AND THIS TIME HE CHANGED THE ORIGINAL POSTING OF MUTLU
JUST TO ACCUSE HIM TO BE A LIAR.

Davidian, thank you for writing the page number correctly...

You are the biggest liar I have ever seen.This example showed me that tomorrow
you can lie again, and you may try to make me a liar this time.So I decided
not to read your articles and not to write answers to you.I also advise
all the netters to do the same.We can not prevent your lies, but at least
we may save time by not dealing with your lies.

And for the following line:

I also return all the insults you wrote about Mutlu to you.
I hope you will be drowned in your lies.

n>crap posted by Mr. [(*]!
 
 o boy!   
 
 Please, can you tell us why those quotes are ""crap""?..because you do not 
 like them!!!...because they really exist...why?
 
 As I said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source 
 given by Serdar Argic .. 
  
 You couldn't reject it...
 
 
 Here we go again..
 In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give 
 the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!
 (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of
 pages, please ask by sct) 
 
 
I really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924)
What I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in
the given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your
groundless accussations, etc. 
 
[...]
 
 
 I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)
 and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published
 in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you
 are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..
 
 Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)
 
 First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You
 called Serdar Argic a liar!..
 I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...
 (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)
 
 And now, you are lying again and talking about ""modified,re-published book""
(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..
 (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was
  first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty 
  well suited theories', as usual)
 
 And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who
 wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number
 and page numbers again for the library use, which are:  
                 949.6 R 198
   
  and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215
              
     
 
 
 Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying ""it is
 not possible..."" ..If not, what is your point?
 
 Differences in the number of pages?
 Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..
 No need to use the same book size and the same letter 
 charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!
 
 The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year
 first published.. 
 And you tried to hide the whole point..
 the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about
 how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given 
 by Serdar Argic exist!! 
 It was the issue, wasn't-it?  
 
 you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway? 
 
 You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a ""crap""..
 People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still
 has so many ""craps"" in the 1993. 
 
 Any question?

Well, apparently we have another son of Dro 'the Butcher' to contend with. 
You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on
distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel 
that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum 
you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to 
another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact.

I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line, 
lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan 
to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is 
nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in 
x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship, 
that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel 
free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists,
the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian
criminal organizations.

Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men,
women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. You, and 
those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.

Maris, Klein, Jackson, Waner, and probably a few others.  This is not a
knock on Winfield, but a comment on his consistency: all of those other

Alberto, you've repeatedly misunderstood my postings.  You are now making the exact point
that I've made several times but with a different definition of religion.  You don't not
have to believe in the ""religious"" aspects of Judaism to be a Jew (this would confine
Judaism to be just a religion in the sense of a Christianity.).  So, by converting out of
Judaism, I don't mean just not believing in the god of Judaism.  I mean voluntarily
removing yourself from the Jewish nation.  I am an agnostic but still consider myself
Jewish because of my cultural heritage.  (I admit that many religious jews would argue
that I am not completely jewish because of my lack of faith, but Judaism is a religion of
dissent and debate isn't it?).  The fact that one can opt to become Jewish simply by
converting to Judaism makes the nation of the jewish people the *least* racist and most
open nation.  We have no quotas!

So I will once again make my point.  Defining a member of the Jewish nation by religion

   CHECK MENAHEM BEGIN DAIRIES (published book) you'll find accounts of the
   massacres there including Deir Yassen,
   though with the numbers of massacred men, children and women are 
   greatly minimized.

As per request of Hasan:

From _The Revolt_, by Menachem Begin, Dell Publishing, NY, 1977:

[pp. 225-227]

    ""Apart from the military aspect, there is a moral aspect to the
story of Dir Yassin. At that village, whose name was publicized
throughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had
four killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was
nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab
troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting
was thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated
throughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian
population of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the
battle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed
at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women,
children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the
slopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw
away the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own
risk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants
obeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their
stone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy
was murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent
testimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to
overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the
civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable
casualties.

    ""The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of
revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We
never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in
accordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am
convinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single
unnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw
stones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do
well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].

    ""In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency
found it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr.
Ben Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise
ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise
ruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the
bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal
superciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews
were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of
'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave
of lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.'

    ""The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the
result it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel.
Kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the
Haganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting.
Beit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main
road; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the
Haganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the
rest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even
before they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir
Yassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the
way to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir
Yassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the
conquest of Haifa.""


[1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) ""To counteract the loss
of Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at
Ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by
Irgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish
officials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this
Arab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced
to reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of
evil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of
terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at

And one Rockie will finish in the top 10 of an offensive catagory this

And no Rockie starter will have an ERA below 3.50.

And the Rangers fade will not begin until...August. They'll give way

Your ignorance is hardly characteristic of most '*ians'. Sarkis Atamian 
explains in his book called 'The Armenian Community, New York 1955, 
Philosophical Library' that, according to historians, original fatherland 
of the Armenians was in Thessaly, Greece. Armenian invaders burned and 
sacked the fatherland of Urartus, massacred and exterminated its population 
and presented to the world all those left from the Urartus, as the Armenian 
civilization. All reliable western historians describe how Armenians 
ruthlessly exterminated 2.5 million Muslim women, children and elderly 
people of Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of 
the Muslim people between 1914-1920. It is unfortunately a truth that 
Armenians are known as collaborators of the Nazis during World War II 
and that, even today, criminal members of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism 
Triangle preach and instigate racism, hatred, violence and terrorism 
among peoples. 


Who says 'Arromdians' are no damn good? During World War II Armenians 
were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over 
the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication in Germany, Hairenik, 
carried statements as follows:[1]

""Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)
 when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it 
 becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon
 method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical
 operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing."" 

Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews -
extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the San
Francisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published
in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian.

 ""We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities
  against our people (Jews). Members of our family witnessed the 
  murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian 
  neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish 
  and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see 
  the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors.
  Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise 
  to grant themselves government if, in return, the Armenians would 
  help exterminate Jews. Armenians were also hearty proponents of
  the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists.""

Sigh.  Here we go again.                     


Must I?  If I were to say that batting average is a predictor that 
can be used to judge which of two hitters is more likely to get a
hit on a particular plate appearance, is that only valid if I can
define the skill in hitting a baseball?  That's all I've said, 
except I used the smaller sample of batting average in clutch situations.


I did not say I could predict the future.  I've suggested that the
statistic is not necessarily meaningless.  Here's the data for this
situation:

		Non-Clutch			Clutch	 
		AB	H	BA		AB	H	BA

Sabo		1539	452	.294		259	59	.228
Samuel		1564	383	.245		278	83	.299	


If you were to have been the Reds manager at that time, I assume you
would have had some basis for letting Sabo hit rather than pinch-
hitting Samuel.  I'm sure some of that basis would have utilized
prior performance.  You just wouldn't have used this particular
aspect of prior performance.  Is this not correct?




One more time.  I did *not* claim to be able to predict the future.
I said that I accept the above data as an indication that Samuel would
have had a better chance for success in that situation than Sabo.

And I am not dismissing your work.  I'm stating my opinion.
You are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary
invalid, so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult
to your work.



I did not say that clutch-hitting is well defined.

	I said that the data is significant  to me.

I did not say that it is a consistent skill.

	I have said that it is an indicator of performance under a
	certain set of circumstances.
	



And, [big sigh]


I have NOT
	NOT
	 NOT
	  NOT
	   NOT
	    NOT
	     NOT EVER called you or anyone else on r.s.b. ""stupid"".


It is nice, however, to see that you will consider the possibility
that you actually could have some preconceived biases.



Ah.  I knew we could get to the name calling.  And there's that word
you like so much.



Wait a minute.  I thought I first had to define clutch hitting.
Do I, or don't I?


I made two statements in my post.

1.	I am not convinced of your conclusions regarding clutch hitting.

2.	I would have hit for Sabo.


As for #2, many of us make a number of written statements through 
this media about what we think will happen in baseball.  I'm not
shy about it.  I'll make the statement again.  I believe that by
season's end that Chris Sabo's batting average in clutch situations
will be significantly lower than his batting average in non-clutch
situations.  I can't prove that it will happen, so I guess we'll 
just have to wait and see.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - - - -
Here's another one for you.  In 1989 - 1991 Joe Carter's batting
average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting
average in non-clutch situations each year.  I presume you think
this is random.  

Non-Clutch:	1585 AB		411 H		.259
Clutch:		 338 AB		 68 H		.201

So what could we expect in 1992 from Mr. Carter?

Well, his composite BA through 1989 was .268;  through 1990 was
.262;  through 1991 was .263, so I think we have a pretty good
idea of what kind of batting average he can produce.  In 1992
he hit .264.  Not surprising, huh?  Also in 1992: 

Non-Clutch:	 536 AB		144 H		.269
Clutch:		  86 AB		 20 H		.233

No, this doesn't prove any overall statistical trend that can
be used to predict future performance across the breadth of 
major league ballplayers.  It just makes me think that in 1993
Joe Carter's batting average in the clutch is not going to be
as high as his ba in non-clutch situations.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 
As for #1 (above), I have plenty of company.  John Dewan of STATS,INC. is
the editor of The Scouting Report wherein the statistics regarding
clutch hitting are compiled, reported and referenced in the text.
Bill James makes numerous references to a player's ability to hit
well in the clutch.  I am not saying that I can predict the future
any more than they are.   You (and others) are saying that your
work renders their statements (and mine) meaningless.  I don't 
accept that, which in your words proves that I am a ""total idiot"".


""Stupid"".  ""Total idiot"".

compound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped.
   This is their story, gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them
who are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the 
six said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world    
since Koresh's right-hand man, Steve Schneider, ripped out the compounds's 
phone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the
cults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out.
    They kept their word. By dawn, tanks were battering the Mount Carmel
compound, punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. The BD
meanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. Strapped into gas masks, the
women did laundry. Others read Bibles in their rooms. The 17 children, all
under 10, remained by their mothers' sides. Still, it was hard to ignore what    
was happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building
it shook violently. Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors.
Hundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling
the air with noxious fumes. The flying canisters were more frightening than
the tanks. At least one man was hit in the face. The gas began filling the air,
driven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks
made. Scattered throughout the house, the cult members made no efforts to
gather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle
headed for a chamber, lined with cinder blocks, where authorities hoped to 
find Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them.
  Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. The
FBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cult
members, in separate discussions with lawyers, consistently gave versions
at odds with the FBI's account. They say the tank flattened a barrel of 
propane, spilling its contents. And as the tank thundered through the house,
it tipped over lit lanterns, spitting flames that ignited the propane and
other flammables. The home of used lumber, plywood, and wallboard tacked 
together with tar paper was vulnerable. The building erupted. Nine BD's
escaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings. Others

Well, actually, most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is
based on some fantasy of how it happened. But that's OK, I understand you
have a hockey background. Stats like ""plus/minus"" make RBI look good.


OK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here's a very simele question to which
I'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please
answer yes or no, Roger:
 Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?
AL only, please.

For anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact
that a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the
team scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite,
hard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a
rule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,
for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.
So, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that
they scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other
things being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack
Morris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238
for Boston), the ""Red Jays"" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or
enough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola
pitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in
(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you
really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs
his team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this
analysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would
necessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but
that is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and
evaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that ""had Morris
performed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.""

Generally I agree with you. However, (1) last night ESPN cut away to Baseball
Tonite, which looks like SportsCenter tailored to baseball, and they cut
away at 7:40 pacific. That's quite a contract they have there. (2) if
ESPN couldn't deliver, they should have had a transistion plan to
let SportsChannel pick up the slack.

season baseball has precedence over playoff hockey in the U.S.

Okay, I think we all agree that singles hitters should take a

Would these guys have a better slugging percentage if they took

to go up there and take a few pitches, he will draw more walks, but
he also won't hit as many frozen ropes into the bleachers because
he is more likely to hold back on a pitch that he used to drive.

The ""Patient/Power"" guys?   Joe Morgan had a small strike zone and
Rickey Henderson has ""a strike zone the size of Hitler's heart"" 
so they get their walks based on the small zone.

Look at the other 5 guys: Thomas, Bonds, McGwire, Ruth and Williams.  Wow!

walk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them.

I am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling
or perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points.
However, I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of the
people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I
feel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to
go but that they would deserve it more. 

IMHO 
Dave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he
could hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not
think he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the
game. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I
still would not back him for the Hall of Fame.

Dave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several
season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are
(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a
bit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other
people but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial
contributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are
some of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he
was with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to
and while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I
think it deserves some consideration.

Lee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would
deserve to go before the likes of Kingman.

Darrell Evans - No.

Eddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although
a silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not
sure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both
the average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just
think, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.

Jeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the
top of my head I would take Lee Smith first.


Well, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I
talked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been
instumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very
good offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers
offensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for
every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have
shattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved
games? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a
game? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more
than numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).
Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does
George Brett who also belongs in this class of player.


Steve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone
making a case for him. 

Jack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might
bring up his name.

Kirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still
has time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my
probably will turn into a definately.

Nolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him
having some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not
hear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the
contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would
not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even
top 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame
because of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -
even with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL
the possible votes.

So in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do
but I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least
not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.

Yes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan
Maybe - Murray and L. Smith
No - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman

Not necessarily.  It could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit
a lot better at home than he did on the road (see Frank Thomas' home/road
splits in '91 for an example).  I would guess that some of Alomar's split
is due to the Skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence.
There's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome
seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and
Alomar is not a home run hitter.


Only because of t&P's bogus fielding stats, which rate Alomar as the worst
defensive second baseman in the league.  On a career basis, I think T&P's
fielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up
with ridiculous results like this.  Alomar may not be the god of fielding
the media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball.

Offensively, T&P rate Alomar much higher last year.

Regarding the A vs. B argument, I'll just say they're both very good players
with different strengths and a bright future.

That is the result of watching anti-Muslim 'SDPA' Nazis/crooks/idiots 
too much. Still covering up the crimes of your fascist Armenian grandparents 
and Nazi Armenian parents? Not a chance. As early as 1934, K. S. Papazian 
asserted in 'Patriotism Perverted' that the Armenians

        'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism.'[1]

At that time, he could not have foreseen that the Armenians would
actively assume a pro-German stance and even collaborate in World
War II. His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of the Muslim
population of Eastern Anatolia. However, extreme rightwing ideological
tendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before
the outbreak of the Second World War.

In 1936, for example, O. Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons' was quoted
in the 'Hairenik Weekly:' 

""The race is force: it is treasure. If we follow history we shall 
 see that races, due to their innate force, have created the nations
 and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to
 the race after becoming a nation. Today Germany and Italy are
 strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race.
 On the other hand, Russia is comparatively weak because she is
 bereft of social sanctities.""[2]

   Refuge' by O. Zarmooni.

In April 1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus.
A number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German
officials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian
Paikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku.
Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his
Armenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the
creation of an Armenian SS formation in order 

""to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the 
 spirit of the Nazi ideas.""

He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories
of the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish
homeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels
Propaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language
radio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were
produced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2]

The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored
by General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the
establishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any 
official position. His views were represented by his men in the
respective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro
and Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942.
Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after
a long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to
Berlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1] 

A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not
'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy.
As such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenians
were the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August 
1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of
Racial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs.

Is there any Israeli a civilian, in your opinion ?

Now, I do not condone myself bombing villages, any kind of villages.
But you claim these are villages with civilians, and Iraelis claim they are 
camps filled with terrorists. You claim that israelis shell the villages with the
'hope' of finding a terrorist or so. If they kill one, fine, if not, too bad, 
civilians die, right ? I am not so sure. 

As somebody wrote, Saddam Hussein had no problems using civilians in disgusting
manner. And he also claimed 'civilians murdered'. Let me ask you, isn't there 
at least a slight chance that you (not only, and the question is very general, 
no insult) are doing a similar type of propaganda in respect to civilians in
southern Lebanon ?

Now, a lot people who post here consider 'Israeli soil' kind of Mediteranean sea.

recognize the state of Israel, you condone killing israelis anywhere.

question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing
justifies murder. I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make
similar statements, maybe after eliminating all Israelis, jews, ? Am I wrong ?

There was a thriving community in Gaza city from roughly 1200-1500.

The theory is that the hollering kills the spirit of the criminal/Nazi 
Armenians of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle. 
Now, try dealing with the rest of what I wrote.

What is more, the activities of the Armenian Government seem to have been
efforts aimed at eradicating a race (the Turks) or aimed at carrying out a
one-sided feud, instead of being a struggle for liberation. From the outset,
the efforts of the Armenian revolutionaries within the Ottoman borders took
the form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder, cruelty
and genocide, so that no other interpretation of them is possible. Armenian
activities started during the reign of Abdulhamid II as individual acts of
terror, and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks. The element
of brute force in these activities increased steadily, culminating in mass
rebellions and widespread fighting during the First World War. Furthermore,
when the Ottoman army withdrew from Eastern Anatolia after the 1915 Sarikamis
defeat, Armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area.
Although the Russians occupied Eastern Anatolia as an enemy, nevertheless they
were constrained by the rules of war. However, when they returned to their
country in 1917 after the Revolution, Armenian revolutionaries were unchecked
in this area for about a year until the Ottoman forces returned to Erzurum
in 1918. During this period, Armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on
the local people which is recorded in historical documents.[1]

For example, let us look at a report dated 21 March 1918 which the Commander
of the Third Army submitted when he entered Erzurum and Erzincan: 

 ""They were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down 
  by Armenians, even the trees were cut down, and they are like a 
  building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word."" 

As for the people who had been living in Erzurum and Erzincan:

""Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning
 with the excuse of forced labor in road construction, they were taken
 in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated. When the Russian army
 withdrew, a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian
 massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells, they were locked
 in houses and burned down, they were killed with bayonets and swords, in places
 selected as butchering spots, their bellies were torn open, their lungs
 were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after
 being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part 
 of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the
 cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering
 from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived
 in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to.
 Including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not
 exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in
 Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled, everything
 that the people had has been taken away from them, and we found them
 in a destitute situation. At the present time, the people are subsisting
 on some food they obtained, impelled by starvation, from Russian storages
 left behind after their occupation of this area.""[2]
 
Foreign observers who witnessed the events, including Russian Officers
who did not desert their lines, submitted detailed reports proving the
genocide to Ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war.
What is most important is that they stated in their reports 'the 
massacres did not happen by chance but were planned.'[3]

At the end of the war, the German author Dr. Weiss, his Austrian colleague
Dr. Stein and his Turkish colleague Mr. Ahmet Vefik visited Trabzon, Kars,
Erzurum and Batum between April 17th and May 20th 1918 to record the
cruelties. Their writings not only show the scope of Armenian activities,
but also reveal their goal and true nature.[4]

Is that what turns you on? The truth needs to be told over and over 
again. There are Armenians who of course witnessed the Armenian genocide 
of 2.5 million Muslim people between 1914-1920 but their voices of truth 
are suppressed today in the hollow din of anti-Turkish/Muslim campaign
by the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle of the fascist 
x-Soviet Armenian Government. Well, that is what I saw in the library.
What's your problem with this?

""It seems that terrorism against their own co-nationals has been a prominent

  Zivin that 'in the interests of humanity the Armenians should not

  commenced. Hence all the trouble; for the Armenians at once commenced
  the wholesale robbery and persecution of the Muslem population on the
  pretext that it was necessary forcibly to deprive them of their arms.

  to carry out their purpose, and the manner in which this was done will

AZERBAIJAN'S GOVERNMENT APPEALS TO COMPATRIOTS ALL OVER THE WORLD

   BAKU (APRIL 5) TURAN: Today, Azerbaijan's government appealed 
to Azeris all over the world in connection with escalation of the 
Armenian aggression against the republic.  
  It is stressed in appeal that the experience of five-years of fighting
for independence from imperial chains shows a grim process . The war
against Azerbaijan under the pretence of protecting the human rights of 
the Armenians of Ukhari (Upper) Garabag, has meant the destruction of
Azeri villages and towns, occupation of 10 percent of the territory, 60
thousand new refugees in addition to 500 thousand already in place.
This is all the price of fighting for liberty from Russian imperial rule,
is said in the document. 
   Azerbaijan's government appeals to all compatriots to make every
effort to inform the people of the world about the truth in Azerbaijan,
and to assistance in solving the problems facing the young state.
   It is stressed in the appeal that there is urgent need for medicine,
food, experienced doctors and financial help to settle refugees from
Kelbajar, Fizuli and Lachin regions, and to render medical aid for the

STATEMENT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF AZERBAIJAN

   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan 
issued a statement in connection with aggression of Armenia in the
region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan.
   It is stated in the statement that regular units of the armed
forces of Armenia captured the town of Kelbajar on April 3 .
  Attack of Armenian units, which began on March 27 deep in the
territory of Azerbaijan still continues. Armenia has occupied at
present 7500 sq.km of the territory of Azerbaijan.
   Spreading of Armenian aggression far away from Ukhari (Upper)
Garabag proves that the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflicts has entered a
specially dangerous phase. This is the result of non-recognition of 
Armenia as an aggressor by the international community, is marked
in the document.
   It is stressed in the statement that the units of the 7th Russian
army are participating in the Armenian attack. This casts doubt on
the sincerity of Russian mediation efforts in finding a peaceful
solution to the conflict.
   It is marked in conclusion that aggressive actions of Armenia 
have wrecked the negotiation process under aegis of CSCE.
   The document contains the appeal to the world community to stop
Armenian aggression and to use political and economic sanctions
against the aggressor.--0--

Playoffs:
---------
*Stauber disturbed by third-man theme
by Rick Sadowski, Daily News

Barry Melrose's decision to stick Robb Stauber in the stands rather than in the
crease or even on the bench for the Stanley Cup playoffs does not sit well with
the rookie goaltender.

""I want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year, the most
fun time of the year, and I'm not,""  Stauber said with some emotion Monday.  ""I
think I have worked hard enough for that.""

Stauber said he accepts Melrose's choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goalie
in their playoff series with the Calgary Flames. Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays
6-3 opening victory.

But Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick
Knickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the
stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.

Knickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was 
yanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since March 29.

Yet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backup
again and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic
Saddledome popcorn.

""If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I
dropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?""  Stauber wondered.  ""Not that I'd be
happy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the
playoffs.""

Perhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not
convinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.

While insisting he is the Kings' ""goalie of the future,"" Melrose said Stauber
flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,
according to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New
York Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to 
Vancouver on Thursday.

""Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could
have taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn't do it,"" Melrose said.  ""An
elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a
great goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup.""

""I'm not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you're going to be No. 1, you've
got to be able to walk your talk.  You've got to be able to play when everything
is on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect
more from him than he does.""

Ouch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the
team hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after Knickle was signed
off the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.

""I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,"" said Stauber,
a three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only 
to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.

""What I've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated
disk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do
expect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here.""

""Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  I'm not saying Barry 
doesn't know me, but don't say I've been without expectations.  If anything, I'm
a perfectionist.""

Stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. ""But 
even though I didn't play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It's 
a bit of a jump,"" he said.  ""You're almost No. 1, or if you play a good game 
you're No. 1 and if you don't you're No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 
and then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That's what barry wanted me to explain 
to him, why I didn't come through when he counted on me.  I don't know. What I 
do know is, it's a sport.  I'll be there.""

Melrose's ""goalie of the future"" statement doesn't mean much to Stauber. ""Before
you know it, I'll be 30 and there will be no future,"" he said.

Ahhh, of course. Israeli morality pales in the face of charming events 
like the string of PLO-run skyjackings in the mid 80's (remember those 
TWA jokes?), and not to forget the Achille Lauro and however many airline
bombings they have committed, not to mention bombings on the streets of 
Israel (It's gotten to a point where children are told not to go near any
bags or containers whose origins they don't know, because they could be 
bombs), or last weeks Katyusha rocket attack on Northern Israel by Fatah,
those wonderful ""mainstream moderates"" with whom Israel is attempting
to negotiate.

Let's not forget the fact that more Palestinians are killed by Palestinians
than by Israelis.  Ahh yes, those charming humanitarian death squads.
I've actually seen a videotape of an interrogation (DSee the documentary 
_Deadly Currents_--very neutral and balanced--seriously)--It was rather 
inquisition-esque. essentially, to prove his loyalty to ""the cause"" of
whichever group it was that was interogating him, he had to turn in someone
else, or else face death in one of the many fun-filled ways that the death-
squads love so much--beatings, dismemberment, acid, pouring melted plastic
on the face of the 'guilty party,' and of course beheading, always my 
favorite.  Did you catch the photos in the Washington Post a while back 
the execution of a ""collaborator?""  3 photos:
1) one Palestinian leading another at gunpoint.
2) The ""collaborator"" on his knees, the gun pointed at his temple.
3) The executioner standing on the corpse of the ""collaborator
shouting about how this is what happens to collaborators.

Wonderful justice system, and lots of regard for Human rights.

Hasn't enyone heard of a leader's recon?  This is when the leader of the
assult goes and looks at the objective to see if anything has changed that
would affect the mission.  Even the Freshman cadets here in ROTCland
know about them.  Mostly because they know it as the part where they

OK. Lets look into this.
According to my dictionary,
Zi-on-ism: an international movement orig. for the establishment of a Jewish
national or religious community in Palestine and later for the support of
modern Israel.

Now, I do not support the establishment of nations based on religious 
principles, while I support the establishment of nations based on cultural
identities.

So. Here are some questions I have to ask for anyone to answer. My point
is what someone said long time ago: In politics, like with men, it is important
to distiguish between what they say they do and what they are actually
doing.

1) My mother is Jewish (and so is my father). If I apply for the Law of
Return, do I get in as a Jew trying to return to his land, from which my
family was expelled about 2000 years ago?
2) If I go back, which nationality would my ID show?
3) If I decided to go back to the land from which my relatives had been 
expelled 2000 years ago, but first I convert to any other religion, can I 
apply to the law of Return as a member of the Jewish Nation or should I 
apply as someone whose mother is Jewish?
4) Which nationality would show my ID in case 3)?
5) What has change in me between the day before and the day after I converted
to loose my being part of the Jewish Nation?
6) Suppose I want to get married to my current wife, who is non-Jewish in
Israel, how do I do it?
7) How would my situation change if I decided, after going back to
Israel, to convert to Islam?


Now, here is one more question. I do believe that most people in a country
do not care about politics. They just want to be left alone.
Suppose my father is Arab. Suppose he was born in Palestine, in some place 
which now is part of Israel. Suppose that his father, and his grandfather as
well as 20 or 30 generations before him were born in that place.
Now suppose there is a war of independence and my father, scared by all the
fighting going on, tries to take his family to a place more secure, among 
people he knows, who speak a language he understands, who worship the same
god. Now, suppose that that place is some other Arab country. 
And, now suppose that the war is over and that there is a new country created
where my father used to live, and that that country is called Israel.
And, that in that country, Jews from all over the world are received. And
that people whose family left thet country 200 generation ago are recieved and
granted full-citizenship.
Should I, if I decided to go back to my father's land, where he was born as
20 or 30 generations of my family were born, have the right to go back and
ask to be recognized in the same way those who are returning after 2000
years?

Then, finally, people ask me how I would define a Jew, but that is irrelevant.
I am not talking about how I would define a Jew, but about how people in 
Zionist organizations, and more important, in Israel, define a Jew.
How would those who are Zionist define a Jew?

""Muslim"" in ex-Yugoslavia was a *nation* not a religion.  In fact, not
all Muslims in B-H are followers of Islam.  Therefore, there do (did?)
exist in ex-Yugoslavia ""Christian Muslims.""  Tito defined the Muslim 
nation constitutionally, adding Muslims to Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes,
the three founding nations which entered into a voluntary union at the
end of WWI.  In addition, Tito added two other nations constitutionally:
Montenegrins, and Makedonijans. 

Nations had the right of secession, but republics did not.  So, ""Muslim""
is much more a political term than a religious term (for those who 
differentiate between religion and politics, that is) in B-H.  It was not 
a ""Christo-Slavic"" ideology that made a Muslim nation in Yugoslavia, it
was the ""Atheist Communist"" ideology of Tito.  Before Tito, there was
no Muslim nation in Yugoslavia.  

The war is not a religious war, and it is not an ethnic war.  It is a
civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns

By Lance Gay, Scripps-Howard News Service
 
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- In this land of historic hatreds, a tiny
Jewish community is braving Serbian shells to repay a 50-year-old debt to
Muslims who saved Jews from the Holocaust.
 
Ivica Ceresnjes, president of the Jewish Community of Sarajevo, says he
and about 1,000 other Jews chose to remain in Sarajevo, rather than leave
for Israel, to keep a feeding center in the medieval old town district
running.
 
Ceresnjes said that was partly in gratitude to the Muslims who hid Jews during
the Nazi occupation and partly to keep intact the centuries-old presence of 
Jews living in Sarajevo.
 
``Some with guns are defending Bosnia, but I fight in Bosnia by keeping 
people alive,'' Ceresnjes said.
 
As a student of Balkan history, Ceresnjes said he saw this war coming and 
had ready plans to evacuate children and the elderly. A year before the war
erupted here last April, Ceresnjes said the Jewish center began
stockpiling supplies, ensuring everyone had passports and arranging for
places in Israel and Europe for the evacuees.
 
They were so well prepared, he said, that only five days after the
shooting began the first plane left. Of about 2,000 Jews in Bosnia-
Herzegovina, he estimates half have left. Many of those who stayed behind
work in Sarajevo's downtown synagogue, which has been turned into a
wartime feeding center that has so far given away 380,000 meals.
 
The center, which has been shelled several times along with most of
Sarajevo, also runs a radio station, mail center and distributes food
packages sent by Jewish organizations around the world.
 
While Muslims and Jews are fighting each other in the Mideast, Jews here
say there's a long tradition of cooperation, inter-marriage and
tolerance between the two communities in Sarajevo that goes back to
centuries of Turkish occupation.
 
Sarajevo's Jews trace their ancestry back to their expulsion from Roman
Catholic Spain in 1492. The community numbered more than 14,000 before
World War II. But only 10% survived the Holocaust -- which was carried out
by the pro-Nazi Croatian Ustache in Yugoslavia. Many of the survivors were
hidden by Muslim families in Mostar.

No.  Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost, and Ron Hextall is the
reason Quebec won.  Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that
goaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're
Montreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it;
he literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an
excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst
goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides,
Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.

Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear
traffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more). 
Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than 
five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME 
ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don't
think this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear 
the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to 
play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.

Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let
the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this
article, if possible.


I didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn't
think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who)
in the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone in
regardless.


Yep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second,
IMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.

Speaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen a
team so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their
zone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red 
Army.  

But I still hate the team.

On the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a
powerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit. 
Same goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely is
waving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something's up.  New
Jersey was overmatched, Terreri's heroics notwithstanding.  Mario is
unbelievable, and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs.  But I 
hate that team anyway.

                An Appeal to Mankind

During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational
population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of
the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights
guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums,
documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.

The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan
though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to
guarantee life and peace.

The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's
tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against
Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied
and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.

Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly
deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland.
Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also
been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan.
Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives 
of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central
Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee
them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.

One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against
Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the
Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific
experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection 
of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.

We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance,
for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are
violated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled,
its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of
Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over 
the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the
USSR and the United States. 

One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and
generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance
while the truth is that all these shootings and recent 
events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on
Azerbaijan.

It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there
were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the
issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly
and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their
representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan
SSR.

We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we 
are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one
of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic 
Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.

But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the
Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists
encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000
Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the 
neighboring lands.

The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales,
suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.

But what about the lives of seven million human beings?
If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are
less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their 
colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other
attributes?

All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers
for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal
of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous
appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope
that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda
will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and
stimulate at least as much help and compassion for
Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.

But perhaps Turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the Caucasus
in the name of peace and democracy. The Armenians are Christians, the
Azerbaijanis are Moslems, and Islam is a religion especially unloved
by the democrat-westernizers. Besides, at the root of this conflict
lie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan, a consequence of which
were the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people, hundreds of
thousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights. 

Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred
thousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and
Human Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims
at 3,145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. This whole
thing has now gone entirely too far.


They already did. The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 
78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this 
time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the 
plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs. 

Report taken from The New York Times, Tuesday, March 3, 1992

                    MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED

     Agdam,Azerbaijan,March 2 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence emerged today 
of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh, 
a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan.
     The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed
1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and 
massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered
mountain passes.
     But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani
reports of a massacre.

                         Scalping Reported
     Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region
by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their
heads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them 
from retrieving more bodies.
     ""Women and children have been scalped,"" said Assad Faradshev, an aide
to Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. ""When we began to pick up bodies,
they began firing at us.""

                         Truckloads of Bodies
     Near Agdam on the outskirts of Nagorno-Karabakh, a Reuters photographer,
Frederique Lengaigne, said she had seen two trucks filled with Azerbaijani
bodies.
     ""In the first one I counted 35, and it looked as though there were as
many in the second,"" she said. ""Some had their head cut off, and many had
been burned. They were all men, and a few had been wearing khaki uniforms.

 Well, here in Detroit we get to see and hear Don Cherry quite regularly.
The Detroit area picks up Hockey Night in Canada from CBC (ch 9) in
Windsor where we see Don Cherry's Coaches Corner between periods. We
also get to see Don Cherry's Grapevine just before the game. The
Grapevine is a hockey talk show where Don talks to a player or coach
about what else: Hockey.  It's actually a pretty good show and Don
isn't as annoying as he is on Coaches Corner.  I think this is were
Don got his nickname 'Grapes' but I'm not sure.  Don use to coach the
Boston Bruins.  I don't know exactly when that was.  Could someone fill
me in on this info?
  A local radio station here in Detroit (WLLZ) talks to Don every Tuesday
morning.  Personally, I've had my fill of Donny!  He really pisses me off
sometimes.  During the Detroit-Toronto game Monday night on CBC, Don gave
high praise to Doug Gilmour, saying he was a two-way player and not
just a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player
in the game because of that.  That's fine and I agree that Gilmour
is a good two-way player BUT he said the EXACT same thing about Yzerman
about a month ago on a local radio talk show.  What gives?
  It seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from
city to city.
  Don Cherry:  'I think <insert star player name for city that he is in>
              is the best two-way player in the league today.'
 
  There have been other times (can't remember exactly what he said) that he
basically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to.
  Someone here on the net said something about how Don criticized Mario
Lemieux but when the time comes for Don to broadcast the Cup playoffs
from the Civic Center (Yes, I think the Pens will make it out of the
Wales Conference) Don will apologize left and right for his remarks about
Lemieux.  In my opinion, he is an ass.  And I won't change my opinion

crooks and criminals to prove something for you? No wonder you are in 
such a mess. That criminal idiot and 'its' forged/non-existent junk has

for the massacre of the Turkish people that also prevent them from entering 
Turkiye and TRNC. SDPA has yet to renounce its charter which specifically 
calls for the second genocide of the Turkish people. This racist, barbarian

as merely a step on the road to said genocide.

the original article of Mutlu.It is as follows:

you can lie again, and you may try to make me a liar this time.So I decided
not to read your articles and not to write answers to you.I also advise

n>crap posted by Mr. [(*]!
 
 o boy!   
 
 Please, can you tell us why those quotes are ""crap""?..because you do not 
 like them!!!...because they really exist...why?
 
 As I said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source 
 given by Serdar Argic .. 
  
 You couldn't reject it...
 
 
 Here we go again..
 In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give 
 the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!
 (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of
 pages, please ask by sct) 
 
 
I really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924)
What I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in
the given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your
groundless accussations, etc. 
 
[...]
 
 
 I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)
 and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published
 in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you
 are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..
 
 Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)
 
 First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You
 called Serdar Argic a liar!..
 I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...
 (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)
 
 And now, you are lying again and talking about ""modified,re-published book""
(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..
 (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was
  first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty 
  well suited theories', as usual)
 
 And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who
 wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number
 and page numbers again for the library use, which are:  
                 949.6 R 198
   
  and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215
              
     
 
 
 Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying ""it is
 not possible..."" ..If not, what is your point?
 
 Differences in the number of pages?
 Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..
 No need to use the same book size and the same letter 
 charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!
 
 The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year
 first published.. 
 And you tried to hide the whole point..
 the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about
 how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given 
 by Serdar Argic exist!! 
 It was the issue, wasn't-it?  
 
 you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway? 
 
 You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a ""crap""..
 People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still
 has so many ""craps"" in the 1993. 
 
 Any question?

Well, apparently we have another son of Dro 'the Butcher' to contend with. 
You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on
distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel 
that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum 
you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to 
another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact.

I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line, 
lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan 
to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is 
nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in 
x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship, 
that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel 
free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists,
the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian
criminal organizations.

Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men,
women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. You, and 
those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.

(anyone can check it at her/his library ,if not , i can send you the copies of pages , please ask by sct) i really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924) what i care about is what the book writes about murders , tortures ,et . .in the given quotes by serdar argic , and your denial of these quotes . .and your groundless accussations , etc . [ . . .] i claim i have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication) and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published in 1934(serdar argic's reference) has . .you couldn't reject it . .but , now you are avoiding the real issues by twisting around . . let's see how you lie! . .(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication) first you said there was no such a quote in the given reference . .you called serdar argic a liar! . . i said to you , no , mr .davidian , there exactly existed such a quote . . . (i even gave the call number , page numbers . .you could't reject it .) and now , you are lying again and talking about ""modified ,re-published book"" (without any proof :how , when , where , by whom , etc . .) . .

Question:
If a team uses 40 players in a season do you merely divide the total +/-
by 40?  If so, a player who plays in only 1 game is considered equally
valuable as a player who plays in all of them.


Since the standard deviation for each team is different, I am unsure how 
""transferable"" between teams that these stats are.  Shouldn't the average
standard deviation in the league be used?

I am interested in seeing each method.
But I still think that mine is the best.

What is this ""Gaza""? Are you purposely separating it from the ""West Bank""?
If so, why separate the people and territories? If not, why are you just
addressing ""Gaza"" here? 

By all means, continue to list the ""etc."" The reason I particularly
bring this up here is that there are **many** from middle eastern
and west asian countries. That fact in itself **adds** an important
element to any consideration of ""resolution"" of the Arab-Israel
conflict.


You explained what ""sea"" meant with regard to the Israelis/jews,
please do so in this case.


""Just""? You better not ask for that because that would mean North 
American tribes would be returned their lands, the pre-Islamic tribes 
would take back their lands from the Islamic invaders, the Saxons get 
to kick the Normans out of the UK, the central and south american 
tribes get to kick the spanish descendents out of thier lands..... 
And, once we have returned the land to those who last possessed it, 
we have to find out from whom **they** stole it. At some point, *every* 
culture stole the land they are on from previous occupants.


But wait! Now you refer to ""Palestinians"", so what happened to ""Gaza""?

As we both know, most people would choose the third alternative. And,
since you have done so in the past, perhaps you would initiate things by 
presenting your vision of ""resolution"". In doing so, however, the worries
(not paranioas, *worries*) and resonable expectations **of both**
parties should be considered.

3775,"The Isles picked one hell-of-a-time to get their first win all year after being
down after 2 periods. The Caps seemed to have the game in hand playing steady
defense and getting great goaltending from Tabaracci. The Isles power play
philosophy continues to be dump-and-chase which, except for boardaholics like
Flatley, doesn't work against the Caps. I hope Al realizes this!! They have too
many talented finesse players, so why not carry the puck in and set-up??? If
last night's game is any omen, the Isles could be on their way to that ole
championship form; COMING from behind late in a game. My advice to the Caps is
to pounce on those Healy Rebounds. Flatley showed alot of heart by playing the
last period and overtime despite an almost swollen-shut left eye injury
suffered at the hands of Dale Hunter. Ray Ferraro has arrived just in time for
the playoffs showing the fiesty hustle that us Islander fans remember from an 
Italian from the past; JOHN TONELLI!!! It was Tonelli who won a similar game
against the PENS in game 5 on the 82 playoffs. The Isles scored two late third
period goals to send the game into OT tied at 3. In OT, Tonelli scored the game
winner to send the Isles to the next round. The Isles have lacked this tenacity
for years, but perhaps its BACK! It was good to see the Coliseum packed just
like the ole days!!! Good luck to the Isles the rest of the way!!!!!
