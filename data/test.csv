Be fair.  He did walk 6 batters in 6.1 IP.  He also allowed only three
hits, none for extra bases.  Only one run.  A pretty good outing, all
told.

Can you imagine what happens when a magazine explodes? Bullets go flying every

Correction: The *FBI* *says* that two of the nine who escaped said the fire
was deliberately set by cult members.  Since the press was kept miles away,
we have absolutely no independent verification of any of the government's
